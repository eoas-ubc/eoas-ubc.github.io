# Data about project progress

Summaries of "products" delivered (as of Fall 2022) are in Tables 1 and 2. Keep in mind the following notes:

* Transformed courses (major changes): DSCI100, EOSC211, EOSC354, EOSC442
* Courses implementing smaller-scale changes: ENVR300, EOSC112, EOSC116, EOSC310, EOSC325, EOSC326, EOSC340, EOSC372.
* "Accomplishments" or "products" are loosely defined. Each "product" will have a wide range of scope.
* For example, "Faculty directly involved" may have put in a huge amount of time and energy to upgrade their course or some aspect of infrastructure, while others may have incorporated a single resource into one lesson of their course.
* Other examples: "products" may be small (e.g. a single midterm survey used as data) or relatively involved (e.g. establishing how to efficiently deploy and maintain a cloud computing hub) - or anywhere in between.
* All accomplishments are valuable, but characterizing "significance" is impossible in single rows of a table.
* Details of accomplishments are presented throughout this website. There is a page for each course affected, several pages related to dashboards (building, using, deploying, etc.) and numerous pages of guidelines, tutorials and other "products" generated during the project.

**Table 1**: Project "products" counted in terms of their "type":

|Types of project accomplishments|# instances|
|-----|:-----:|
|Total no. students in courses directly impacted 2021-2023|~2300|
|No. [courses](course_materials.md) directly impacted by Fall 2022|17|
|No. faculty directly involved or affected ([list of personnel](project-outline.md))|17|
|No. grad students who learned by contributing ([list of personnel](project-outline.md))|9|
|No. undergrad students who learned by contributing ([list of personnel](project-outline.md))|6|
|Teaching / learning resources produced|17|
|Instances of dashboards use in courses|13|
|Consulting activities (i.e. help & support for instructors)|12|
|Teaching & learning strategies developed|12|
|Dissemination: poster, presentation, etc.|8|
|Planned "product", but no activity to date|7|
|Faculty professional development events or items*|6|
|other|0|

_\* "Faculty professional development events or items" do NOT include all the 1-on-1 work that accompanies development of new resources, pedagogies or logistics. These ongoing interactions are too numerous to count. See the spreadsheet mentioned above for details._

**Table 2:** Numbers of "products" targeting each of the original project goals:

|OCESE project goals|No. 'products'|
|-----|:-----:|
|Enhanced learning of quantitative Earth Science for students in any EOAS course|26|
|Engage with new and existing faculty; Faculty professional development|23|
|Enhanced computational / numerical literacy for EOAS graduates|18|
|Total items that could become _Open Ed Resources_, or OERs| 18|
|Items of documentation|13|
|Development / testing of affordable, sustainable cloud computing facilities|8|
|Support the Faculty of Science Minor in Data Science|5|
