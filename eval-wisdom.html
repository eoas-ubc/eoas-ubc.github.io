<h2>How Evaluated<a class="headerlink" href="#how-evaluated" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>One general measure of success is the rate of adoption of opensource practices introduced during the OCESE project across the Department. Most instructors teaching courses in EOAS that involve computing have committed to teach with Python so students learn quantitative Earth sciences using one language throughout their time in EOAS. Furthermore, there has been wide adoption of Jupyter notebooks as the delivery medium for courses with programing goals, as well as quantitative goals not involving programing. In particular, the newest faculty virtually all use Python in their research, as do nearly all graduate students.</p>
<p>More specific evaluation of OCESE project outcomes depends on the type of change or “product” and the context of their implementation. Table 5 summarizes the evaluation data obtained across the project, organized by the courses for which data were obtained.</p>
<img alt="ocese outcomes by type" class="align-center" src="_images/table-evaldata.png" />
<BR>
 Types of data summarized in Table 5 (columns) include:
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>students’ work, or surveys conducted before, during or after the course;</p></li>
<li><p>saved communication channels used by developers, TAs and instructors (usually email or Slack);</p></li>
<li><p>feedback from students who worked for the project;</p></li>
<li><p>analyzed Piazza discussion-board data; and</p></li>
<li><p>in-person or online class observations.</p></li>
<li><p>A rough idea of the extent to which initiatives were implemented for each course is summarized in the last column.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of the 17 courses listed, 9 have committed to permanent adoption of OCESE project contributions, 6 have incorporated the changes but continued use depends on future instructors keeping those changes in place, and 2 courses (both of which were not part of the original proposal) experimented with use of new dashboards at least once but confirmation of continued use has not yet been obtained.</p>

<div><p><em>“It explains the effects of the contributing factors in a visual way and was straight to the point when explaining with words.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><em>“Very organized and easy to use, simple and concise explanations and good visuals.”</em></p>

<li><p>EOSC 372 student feedback:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>“I liked how the dashboard exercise applied various concepts using real data from the world’s oceans.

<section id="from-slack-email-and-informal-discussions-with-teaching-teams">
<h3>From slack, email and informal discussions with teaching teams<a class="headerlink" href="#from-slack-email-and-informal-discussions-with-teaching-teams" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>These collections of communications were instrumental in keeping abreast of progress, challenges and solutions for the variety of project threads. Lessons learned from these sources are primarily about coordination and execution of educational development projects.</p>
<p>For example, support from graduate students who are simultaneously assigned as teaching assistants has been critical for enabling rapid adjustments when problems occur or providing timely points-of-contact for students. They also can carry out the work of writing, coding, testing and assessing that instructors may have little time for, during development and piloting any major or minor adjustments to a course.</p>
<p>Another lesson learned from engaging with instructors is that some need support to conceive, design and deploy the active learning opportunities enabled by dashboards or Jupyter notebooks. Of course, some instructors are already highly “action oriented” in their pedagogy. However, in other cases it was worth spending OCESE project time helping instructors adjust their teaching strategies so that students can be more engaged with concepts and data sets. This requires repeated engagement at all stages of course design, modification and delivery, as well as followup after teaching the section, and in subsequent terms. These innovations then have to survive future transferals of the course to instructors who were not involved in development, and this is not always guaranteed.</p>
<p>Regarding course conversions to Python (from any other language), the OCESE project has made it clear that converting beginner’s courses are challenging &amp; costly because “everything” must be changed. In comparison, converting courses that expect students to have had at least some prior computing experience is much more straightforward, especially if converting assignments or labs only. However, for any such conversion, the choice of how Jupyter Notebooks or dashboards are served must be made carefully because these hubs or servers must be “bomb-proof” and scalable. Otherwise student learning may be compromised and instructors will experience a highly stressful term.</p>

<section id="from-student-workers-and-ta-feedback">
<h3>From student workers and TA feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#from-student-workers-and-ta-feedback" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Student contributors, whether employed as project workers (usually with UBC Work Learn support) or as teaching assistants, have been a lynch-pin for this project. They carried out all dashboard programming and much of the heavy-lifting of translating courses to Python. All these contributors provided important, insightful and creative input that ensured implementation of most initiatives were as trouble free as possible. Nearly all provided spontaneous, or requested reflections on their work which recognized how much they learned about teaching, learning, coding, or project management. Two workers also sent word from their subsequent employments (after graduating) expressing satisfaction with how lessons they learned as members of this team contributed directly to success in their workplaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>E.g.: <em>“my boss has asked me to convert all our data quality control from excel to python, and to bring the whole team up to speed on doing analysis with Python, which basically means delivering a highly condensed version of EOSC211 to our atmospheric team. … I am using pretty much all the skills I developed over the last 2 years!”.</em></p>

<section id="from-piazza-discussion-board-topics">
<h3>From Piazza discussion board topics<a class="headerlink" href="#from-piazza-discussion-board-topics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Student concerns raised on the Piazza platform seem to be relatively similar in both terms, except for posts regarding quizzes and exams. The higher proportion of these posts in 2021 relates to difficulties with the autograding software. In general, it seems that logistical or infrastructure challenges were less concerning to students than they were to instructors. Students are forgiving and adaptable but are most concerned when grading and turn-around of grades is compromised. More details are given on the <a class="reference internal" href="crs-eosc211.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">EOSC 211 page</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-classroom-observations">
<h3>From classroom observations<a class="headerlink" href="#from-classroom-observations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Courses observed are well taught, perhaps not unexpectedly, since faculty keen to participate in education development projects are already implementing “best practices”. Widespread use of opensource resources and tactics is still evolving, partly because the opensource communities are still fine-tuning their materials, even while testing them in “live” courses. Observations have also shown that some aspects we worried about are less troublesome than anticipated. For example, setting up consistent installations of Python and Jupyter notebook software on all students’ laptops was expected to be labour intensive. But this challenge can be mitigated by careful preparation of “installation environments” followed by one 45 minute lesson (with extra TA support) devoted to installations. For details see our Python and Jupyter Notebook <a class="reference internal" href="python-startup.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">startup page</span></a>.</p>
<p>Observing initial use of dashboards in lessons enabled developers to offer advice on refining the workflow during the lesson. For example, before tackling a real problem with new facilities, students must be given some time to “explore” the new tools to familiarize with the interface and the corresponding tasks. This is well-known from literature on use of simulations in teaching, but advising instructors is easier based on observations rather than depending upon third party publications to convey the recommendations.</p>
