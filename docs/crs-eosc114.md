## OCESE project objectives

1. Develop and implement an interactive exercise that engages students in the complexity of the relationship between Earth's processes and human activity.

2. Build a versatile dashboard to emulate sketch-based learning activities that will allow instructors to specify a background image upon which students can sketch or add annotations. Initial activities are to be based on precedent from activities developed with older software that has become awkward to deploy. Examples are (or were) live at [eg 1](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~quest/Lab3-sketch.html), [eg 2](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~quest/Lab1-2sketches.html) and [eg 3](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~quest/Sketch-NorthAm.html). PDF versions of the lab exercises can be seen at <a href="files/Lab3-sketch.pdf">PDF eg1</a> and <a href="files/Lab1-2sketches.pdf">PDF eg2</a>.

## Actions taken

Discussions between OCESE educational development staff and both teaching assistants & instructors went as far as describing a mind-map or flow-chart approach to enabling students to confront the "cause-and-effect" nature of natural processes that can be hazardous to societies. Driving questions were:

* “In what ways can climate change increase the severity and/or frequency of natural hazards earthquakes?” and
* "Does this hazard affect global climate?”

The expression of initial design work is in a powerpoint slide sequence, here in <a href="files/114-activity3-FJ-210823.pptx">PPTX</a> and <a href="files/114-activity3-FJ-210823.pdf">PDF</a> formats.

A first draft HTML5 interactivity of this climate-mind-map was developed. [Github repo](https://github.com/jamiebyer/climate-mind-map). Instructors wanted to do a “paper” activity based on these ideas first. No further action within OCESE time-frame. 

## Lessons learned

Instructors had little time to be creative during COVID and only used the [Global Temperature](dashboards.md) dashboard because it was completed for other courses. That's OK - people can only apply energy when time and inclination permit.
