## OCESE project objectives

1. Develop and implement an interactive exercise that engages students in the complexity of the relationship between Earth's processes, its climate, human activity and impacts on society.

## Actions taken

Discussions between OCESE educational development staff and both teaching assistants & instructors went as far as describing a mind-map or flow-chart approach to enabling students to confront the "cause-and-effect" nature of natural processes that can be hazardous to societies. Driving questions were:

* “In what ways can climate change increase the severity and/or frequency of natural hazards earthquakes?” and
* "Does this hazard affect global climate?”

The expression of initial design work is in a powerpoint slide sequence, here in <a href="files/114-activity3-FJ-210823.pptx">PPTX</a> and <a href="files/114-activity3-FJ-210823.pdf">PDF</a> formats.

A first draft HTML5 interactivity of this climate-mind-map was developed. [Github repo](https://github.com/jamiebyer/climate-mind-map). Instructors wanted to do a “paper” activity based on these ideas first. No further action within OCESE time-frame. 

## Lessons learned

Instructors had little time to be creative during COVID and only used the [Global Temperature](dashboards.md) dashboard because it was completed for other courses. That's OK - people can only apply energy when time and inclination permit.
