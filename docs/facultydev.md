# Professional development

NOTE: don't discuss project outcomes here - focus on supporting professional development for teaching purposes, for faculty, students and staff.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Original intentions

From the proposal ...

Why were those expectations naive? Two reasons:

1. All 3 years were needed to carry out development & fine tuning of teaching practices and resources, and tutorials or workshops only make sense whith proven techniques and strategies.
2. Development also requires participants to be involved and commit the necessary time and focus throughout their portion of the project. That is challenging when instructors come and go, and everyone is constantly managing "change" necessitated by the enforced pivoting to and from fully or partially online learning.

### 1.2 Timing & COVID

* Project: May 2020 - May 2023
* COVID: March 2020 - ~August 2022, including the summer of 2022 as a time to "recover" from the constant pivotting in the 2020W and 2021W teachig sessions.

## 2. Who

### 2.1 Who *has* received support?

OCESE project has supported development and/or implementation of methods, resources, tactics (eg pedagogy), infrastructure and associated procedures. Faculty partners provide the course as context, define specific needs for each lesson, assignment or assessment, including both resources and methods or procedures.

*Not sure what exactly needs to be included here. A table could be derived from the [OCESE Project Accomplishments spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit#gid=979565415).*

- List of faculty who were supported and/or contributed is on the [project outline page](project-outline.md). 
- Also listed are graduate and undergraduate students who learned by contributing to the project, either as formally hired workers or as teaching assistants with teahcing or support roles in a course.

### 2.2 Who *could* receive support?

Which courses or instructors could benefit from professional development support? Twenty-four EOAS courses currently use computing or dashboard resources. See [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lg9wLZYwIHSVyXzFPO3096d8eLvL6oLn9lShOosBBok/edit#gid=0) of computing in EOAS courses. Thirteen courses need to be asked if they do, or will, use computing (especially open) facilities of any kind.

## 3. Lessons to be conveyed

Faculty Pro-D in the form of docs, guidelines, tutorials are emerging from all project threads, including DSCI100, EOSC211, upper level courses (atsc301, eosc354, eosc410, & others), and dashboard use in courses that do not have students writing code.

Which lessons are appropriate for workshops? Which for one-on-one support?

Who will carry out that kind of support? We have had TAs, WorkLearn students and "staff" helping individuals during preparation and delivery of specific courses. Teaching assistants have been instrumental in supporting development and piloting of new resources, lessons, activities, assignements, labs and assessments. They will likely continue to be invaluable in sustaining existing innovations or developing new ones.

Are any courses "going further" because students are more up to speed with coding or other quantitative practices? EOSC 112 and 340 now access climate models via dashboards. If so, this is a justification for new tactics, not an aspect of "professional development".

### 3.1 Learning Python

### 3.2 Applying Python to course concepts

### 3.3 Ways of deploying Python

* Jupyter notebooks on UBC-supported hubs
* Jupyter notebooks on Department hubs
* Jupyter notebooks via CoLab
* Laptop installations for each student

### 3.4 Assessment workflows

#### 3.4.1 Challenges

Outline the challenges of automatic and manual grading for small, medium or large classes

#### 3.4.2 Solutions

Present a the range of solutions in EOAS & DSCI courses:

* Manual grading using deliver / submit via Canvas; used for smaller courses including EOSC 354,
* [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io); DSCI 100, EOSC 211 (to a lesser extent); what others at UBC? Ask PA, and/or slack
* [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io) (used in EOSC 340)
* [Gradecope](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/gradescope-instructor-guide/); not used in EOAS?
* [Otter-Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/); not used at UBC?
* Hybrid solutions such as nbgrader + manual grading used in EOSC 211.

### 3.5 Using Dashboards for teaching/learning

* Dashboard resources have two purposes (explore data or concepts).
* They are (or have been) used in at least 7 EOAS courses.
* In class for demonstrations or group work
* as enrichment for students
* as part of assignments - solo or group.
* refer to research on using simulations for teaching and learning, eg references involving [PhETs](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/research).

### 3.6 Developing open education practices or resources

Skills considered "open source practices" include using GitHub to collaborate on code or documentation, building content as open resources (eg. as Jupyter Books), collaborating on development of code.

Some instructors already use open source practices for their research or teaching: Heagey, White, Austin, Radic?, some of the grad & ugrad students working on the project. We have benefited from their experience.

Some have begun adopting open source practices for their teaching: C. Johnson, R. Merill, all ugrad and grad students who have participated.

### 3.7 Finally - the "moving target" problem

Development for teaching of (a) tactics for providing students with resources (eg hubs) and (b) efficient assesment practices can not keep pace with changes in the computing community (opensource, or otherwise). Also, different sustainment models have different pros and cons. For example:

* Institutional (UBC) support means technical and support staff get to know the instructors and their courses and can be available "on demand". Institution level support (eg CTLT) benefits more than Department level support from economies of scale. However, support teams still need to keep up with best practices in a very rapidly evolving "ecosystem" of technology. Keeping up to date is more than full time - something specialists can do better than instituitional groups who provide a variety of technical services across campus(es).
* In contrast, third party support for hubs and tech support (eg [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/)) will provide more widely-tested strategies and likely more reliable facilities, but with "fees for service" rather than costs distributed across institutional service groups.

## 4. Resources to reference or make

* Compare deployment options for Jupyter Notebooks. See [for example](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-colab-vs-jupyter-notebook/) a May 2020 comparison of local and Google Colab options. Include...
  * who to ask for advice and support.
  * necessary resources and "start up" costs for students.
* Compare code grading options (small class, medium, large, nbgrader, "by hand", the Johnson/Rossman model for 211).
* Who are the movers and shakers in this space? Which universities? Which organizations? Which individuals?
* Why is it important to include capacity to "keep up to date"? Provide examples of "fails" that would not have happened if solutions and preventative techniques were known from the open community.
