## OCESE project objectives

Introduce interactive dashboard apps to classroom and assignment activities to explore concepts and data sets.

## Resources produced

* [Atmospheric CO_2 at Mauna Loa and South Pole](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/co2mlo) (monthly averages), with user-defined straight line model for crude predictions. 
* [Three signals](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/timeseries): adjustable parameters illustrating noise and trend on a sinewave, with smoothing. Signals, trends, noise and smoothing: a simple interactive dashboard app. to gain familiarity with interactions of these components of signals.
* Links to repositories are on the project's [dashboards page](./dashboards.md).
