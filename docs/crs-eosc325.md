# EOSC 325

## Official description

**Principles of Physical Hydrogeology**: Theories of storage and movement of water within groundwater systems; Groundwater-surface water interaction; Role of groundwater systems in watershed management and regulating the environmental impacts of global change; Groundwater sustainability; Impacts of climate & land use changes on groundwater resources. See the [EOAS course page](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc325) and [UBC Calendar](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=EOSC&course=325) for details.

## OCESE project objectives

Introduce interactive dashboard apps to classroom and assignment activities to explore specific hydrogeologic concepts, models, modelling and data sets.

* [Storativity](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/store): compares hydrological storativity of various geologic materials. Github repository is the "store" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers).

* [Unconfined-flow](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/hydro): an interactive model of linar ("1D") groundwater flow in an unconfined acquifer between two sources, with surface recharge included. Github repository is the "hydro" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers).

* [Drawdown for confined and unconfined acquifers](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/drawdown) plots 2D drawdown curves for a well in a uniform acquifer with adjustable properties. Github repository is the "drawdown" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers).

## Open resources

* Dashboard code repositories above.

## Role in EOAS curriculum

A popular elective for several B.Sc. specializations. Also an acceptible (or required) prerequisite for:

* EOSC 428: Field Techniques in Groundwater Hydrology
* EOSC 429: Groundwater Contamination.
