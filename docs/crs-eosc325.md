## OCESE project objectives

Introduce interactive dashboard apps to classroom and assignment activities to explore specific hydrogeologic concepts, models, modelling and data sets.

Convert question sets for efficient upload to the new course's [Canvas](https://about.canvas.ubc.ca/) website.

Provide geoscience education feedback on lessons for this brand new course.

## Resources produced

These are open education resources (OER) unless indicated otherwise.

* [Storativity](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/store): compares hydrological storativity of various geologic materials. Github repository is the "store" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers).

* [Unconfined-flow](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/hydro): an interactive model of linar ("1D") groundwater flow in an unconfined acquifer between two sources, with surface recharge included. Github repository is the "hydro" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers).

* [Drawdown for confined and unconfined acquifers](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/drawdown) plots 2D drawdown curves for a well in a uniform acquifer with adjustable properties. Github repository is the "drawdown" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers).

Question sets were converted from various formats to Markdown text, then [text2qti](https://github.com/gpoore/text2qti) was used to upload to the courses's [Canvas](https://about.canvas.ubc.ca/) site. See our [tools page](tools.md) for tips.
