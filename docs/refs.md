# Links & pointers

These are of course only a small selection of resources and pointers. There is a huge amount of information in the public domain, easily found by applying some elementary internet searching strategies. The items below were relevant around mid-way of the OCESE project. Many others could be included, however it was considered "out of scope" to provide a more exhaustive bibliography.
