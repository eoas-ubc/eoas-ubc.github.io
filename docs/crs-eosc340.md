## OCESE project objectives

Introduce interactive dashboard apps to classroom and assignment activities to explore specific climate science concepts, models, modelling and data sets.

## Actions taken

Significant effort was expended by one instructor and several student programmers to create dashboard apps for exploring aspects of climate prediction using CMIP6 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project) models and scenarios. Preliminary versions of two apps were completed but not yet tested in class. See "_cmip6-lowcloud_" and "_cmip6-dash_" listed on the [dashboards page](dashboards.md).

## Lessons learned
These were much more challenging to create than any other OCESE dashboard apps. The lesson is (perhaps) to keep the intentions simple, and aim to build resources that can be completed, deployed, tested, and refined within two or three teaching terms.
