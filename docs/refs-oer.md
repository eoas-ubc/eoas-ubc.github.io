# Third-party Open Education Resources

**See also UBC's [OER group](https://oer.open.ubc.ca/) for guidelines related to open education and open research resources and practices.**

This is a representative list (not exaustive) of Open Ed. Resources at UBC for math, physics, compsci, EOAS, etc.

1. Listing of open resources used at UBC is in the [2021 snapshot](https://open.ubc.ca/2021-open-ubc-snapshot/) of all UBC OERs. Its Appendix A is a sample of open and freely available resources used at UBC, listed by course, and with links to each item. SEE ALSO file “opened-UBC.xlsx” in QuEST folder “curriculum development”.
2. UBC OER [examples](https://open.ubc.ca/projects/) here, but some pointers are out of date. However a list of “useful” or “inspirational” resources would be worth while. An example is the EOAS Phyto'pedia - The [Phytoplankton Encyclopaedia Project](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/research/phytoplankton/).
3. Several collections from UBC-GIF are examples of open resources used in EOAS but which are not clearly visible.
    1. GPG – Geophysics for practicing geoscientists (applied geophysics “text”)
    2. gpgLabs – Jupyter Notebook (Python) based interactive apps for all applied geophysics methods & concepts
    3. IAG – Inversion for applied geophysics, an interactive open text akin to GPG. 
    4. Others at https://geosci.xyz/ - EM geophysics, ToolKit, SimPeg, all with GitHub repos. (Ref Lindsey Heagy. )
4. Open source texts & problem sets for calculus I, II, III, IV from Math, UBC: the [CLP Calculus Textbooks](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/). Source code for all texts and problem sets are available on GitHub.
5. The BC based “[Physical Geology](https://open.bccampus.ca/browse-our-collection/find-open-textbooks/?uuid=5ec5dd3f-2da1-4603-807d-035d6a5cf9f0&contributor=&keyword=&subject=)”, via BCcampus.
6. Computer science’s UBC [edX Software Development Program Materials](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ubcx-software-development).
    1. These represent a complete certificate-based program of 6 courses at edX which can be taken for a fee. The fee results in graded work and success yields a “certificate” approach to accreditation. However materials appear to be freely available.
    2. This deserves investigating – can/should EOAS be making use of these for teaching, or generating these for revenue or reputation?
    3. Physics uses a range of [OpenStax textbooks](https://openstax.org/).
7. Seismological Facility for advancement of geoscience - [SAGE](https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass).
8. Geodesy Facility for advancement of geoscience - [GAGE](https://www.unavco.org/education/).
