## EOAS or UBC meetings / workshops

1. **December 2020: Dep't mini retreat**. "_OCESE components and progress_". See [PDF](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas-ubc.github.io/blob/docs/pdffiles/ocese-demo-dec15.pdf) of presentation slides.
**Or this link doesn't work: [PDF](pdffiles/ocese-demo-dec15.pdf)**.
   * OCESE project components - which are attractive to you?
   * Faculty feedback
   * OCESE is working on: Jupyter notebooks and books, dashboards (the "low threshold"), auto-grading & connecting with Canvas, Local Jupyter Hubs and corresponding systems & workflows.
   * students and instructors perspectives.
   * infrastructure.
2. **February 2021: participant meeting.** "_Dashboards: Making Concepts interactive_". See [PDF](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas-ubc.github.io/blob/docs/pdffiles/Fac-ProD-Feb-210215.pdf) of  presentation slides.
   * Interactive learnign resources - precedent. (Targeting the "low threshold" end of the quantitative learnign spectrum.)
   * Initial examples in EOAS - ENVR 300.
   * Associated pedagogy.
   * Brainstorm to discuss courses, topics, objectives, steps.
   * making dashboards: development steps.
