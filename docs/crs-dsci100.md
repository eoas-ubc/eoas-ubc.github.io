* [UBC Calendar](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=DSCI&course=100),
and [ubcexplore](https://ubcexplorer.io/course/DSCI/100).
* Student-facing [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ubc-dsci/dsci-100-student) for the existing "R" version of the course.
* Summary of [selected details](crs-dsci100-details.md) about the Course's Learning Outcomes (CLO's), topics and tools.

## OCESE project objectives

Basically to generate a Python-based version of the course with an Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric sciences context for all exercises.

* Convert all "R" teaching materials to Python
* Convert all "R" classroom and homework exercises to Python
* Adapt the existing course website to suit the Python and EOAS contexts.
* Adapt existing "R"-based [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) grading tactics to work with the Python exercises.
* Adapt existing text book for the Python context.
* Ensure there are stable, sustainable Jupyter Hub facilities at UBC for with reliable tech-support for instructors and teaching assistants.

## Resources produced

These open education resources HAVE YET TO BE PRODUCED but are in progress as of March 2022.

* Python version of the textbook
* Python versions of standard DSCI 100 class activities
* Python versions of DSCI 100 assignments
* (Eventually - Earth science versions of activities and assignments)
* Python versions of questions for assessments.

## Pedagogy
