# DSCI 100 OCESE project progress

## Official description

**Data Science 100: Introduction to Data Science**: Use of data science tools to summarize, visualize, and analyze data. Sensible workflows and clear interpretations are emphasized.

**Links:**
* [UBC Calendar](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=DSCI&course=100),
and [ubcexplore](https://ubcexplorer.io/course/DSCI/100).
* Student-facing [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ubc-dsci/dsci-100-student) for the existing "R" version of the course.
* Summary of [selected details](crs-dsci100-details.md) about the Course's Learning Outcomes (CLO's), topics and tools.

## OCESE project objectives

Basically to generate a Python-based version of the course with an Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric sciences context for all exercises.

1. Convert all "R" classroom and homework exercises and materials to Python
   * Adapt the existing course website to suit the Python and EOAS contexts.
   * Adapt existing "R"-based [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader)grading tactics to work with the Python exercises.
   * Adapt existing text book for the Python context.
2. Establish Earth science context so one section addresses the same learning objectives but using settings that relate to Earth sciences.
3. Ensure there are stable, sustainable Jupyter Hub facilities at UBC for with reliable tech-support for instructors and teaching assistants.

## Resources produced

These open education resources HAVE YET TO BE PRODUCED but are in progress as of March 2022.

* Python version of the textbook
* Python versions of standard DSCI 100 class activities
* Python versions of DSCI 100 assignments
* Earth science versions of activities and assignments
* Python versions of questions for assessments.

## Pedagogy

Anticipated to be essentially identical to the "R" version developed for the original version of the course.

* Question preparation
* Question types
* Grading

## Project evaluation

Essentially "success" at project goal #1 will be achieved once a section of the course is taught in Python, and success at goal #2 will be achieved once there is a section of the course taught with Earth science contexts for the sections.
