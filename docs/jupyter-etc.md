* An [introduction to Juypyter Notebooks](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks). This one is a single page, quite long, but carefully done and "peer reviewed" - i.e. checked by a third party. It includes links to additional resources, including a similarly produced [introduction to Windows command line and power shell](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-powershell), pointers to guidelines for installing Anaconda, and so on. 
* The basic introductory Jupyter documentation is [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/).
