## OCESE project objectives

* Support development, implementation and evaluation of new activities funded by UBC's climate science initiative.

## Resources produced

* Grad students hired for this project develop ideas and OCESE considered options for implementation.
* Completed the [Global Temperature Anomaly](dashboards.md) dashboard used in eosc112 and several other courses.
* A second dashboard ([climate-mind-map](dashboards.md)) was concieved and prototyped, but implementation was put off for a later time.
* Supported development, observed implementation, and coordianted evaulation of an activity based on the IPCC Climate Atlas for EOSC 112 (147 students).

## Pedagogy

The IPCC Climate Atlas activity was worksheet-based. Begun in class, students could work in groups or alone. Getting-started instruction were provided by lecture and instructors & TAs then circulated to ensure students were making progress. The assignment was completed at home with responses delivered to the course's Canvas site for assessment as PDFs or scanned images.

## Project evaluation

These **feedback questions** were posed to students as the last step in their assignment:

* What have you learned by working on this activity?
* Were you surprised by anytyhing you observed?
* What is one question you have that was inspired by this activity?

Processing the results to generate a summary was non-trivial as questions were open ended.

Results from student feedback about the IPCC Climate Atlas activity are summarized in a [**separate PDF file**](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas-ubc.github.io/blob/docs/pdffiles/Data_Science_Report_Sept2019.pdf).
