## OCESE project objectives

* Convert all MatLab teaching materials to Python
* Convert all MatLab classroom and homework exercises to Python
* Implement the course website using Jupyter Books. Include weekly instructions and labs/assignments as Jupyter Notebooks. (See resources below).
* Implement automatic grading practices using the Jupyter Notebook plugin [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader).
* Adapt open source materials to make a suitable text book for programming (and Python) beginners.
* Establish stable, sustainable Jupyter Hub facilities at UBC for with reliable tech-support for instructors and teaching assistants.

## Resources produced

* [EOSC211 course website](https://phaustin.github.io/eosc211/announcements.html), a **Jupyter Book** including calendar of topics, links into relevant sections of the text book, and assignments & labs provided as **Jupyter Notebooks**.
* [Text book](https://phaustin.github.io/Problem-Solving-with-Python/), mainly python programming for beginners. Adapted from [Problem Solving with Python-37](https://github.com/professorkazarinoff/Problem-Solving-with-Python-37-Edition) by Dr. Peter Kazarinof.
* Jupyter Notebooks with Python code exercises and activities for classwork.
* Getting-started instructions for students to install Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Windows or Mac laptops. This was done with 90 students in one  1.5-hour lecture session.
