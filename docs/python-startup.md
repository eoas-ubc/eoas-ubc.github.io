## Why Python

**Python** is a *high level programming language,* meaning it is comparatively easy for humans to read. Python programs are executed by a *python interpreter,* which takes python code, reads it into a processor (the CPU on your computer, or via an internet connection on a suitable server) and returns a result. This process is repeated over and over for each line of code, often taking the result of one line and feeding it into the next.

Python is also *open source*, meaning there are no fees to download/use python, and anyone is free to add to the Python code base. This is a major reason for Python's growing popularity in the scientific community, there are many add ons (called *packages*) developed by other scientists specifically for the type of programming we want to do in this course, with more being added every day!

Python programs can be made to run as stand-alone programs, or - more commonly for educational purposes - a **Jupyter Notebook** can be used as an evironment for writing, debugging and running Python codes.

**Jupyter Notebooks** are an IDE, or integrated development environment which have gained popularity amoung the science and educational communities for processing data, creating scientific figures, solving numerical equations, and sharing code. IDE's are essentially advanced text editors containing features helpful for writing code. A distinguising feature of Jupyter Notebooks is that code is created in "cells", each of which can edited and run independently. Later cells in a notebook normally depend on results of earlier cells, but each cell can be modified and run so long as cells above have been successfully run first. Rich documentation (including equations) is commonly included as independent cells written in a standard MarkDown text-based language.

Jupyter notebooks running Python can be run on a local personal computer. Alternatively, and more commonly for teaching purposes (especially for larger courses of relatively novice programmers), the Notebooks are run via an internet connection in a standard internet browser window. The computer delivering the notebooks is called a **JupyterHub**. It is a computational environment for running jupyter notebooks in the cloud (i.e. on a remote computer via internet connection).
