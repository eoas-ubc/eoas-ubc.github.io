# Progress at November 2022

There is no formal rquirement for a progress report in November 2022 since the project is not applying for renewal of funding.

A final project report is due May 2023, and this documentation website constitutes the complete package.

This page summarize progress between roughly Dec 2021 and Nov 2022.

## 1) Infrastructure development

The UBC-hosted learnign hub at open.jupyter.ubc.ca was implemented for Sept 1st by UBC's Center for Teaching and Learning Technology (CTLT). See the [Jupyter Open home page](https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca/) for details of facilities.

**Fall 2022:** In the Department of EOAS, courses eosc211 and eosc442 piloted usage of the "standard" JupyterLab environment. Other groups at UBC also are using the facility. It was mainly reliable for small (fewer than ~30 students) courses but there were latency and "hanging" difficulties for larger courses. Some quotes derived from communications with colleagues?

"*... we have a few issues with some node slowdowns ... Students are finding the kernels are being very, very slow or failing connection entirely. It seems to be fine when we have < 50 connecting, but above that number we start hitting issues.*"

and

"*quote to come*"

**Late 2022 through summer 2023:** We expect to increase communication among users (instructors of courses using the hub) and suppliers (CTLT). With attention to communications and discussions, it should be feasible to address concerns about the stability / accessibility of open source computing to support the various undergraduate courses across campus.  Many faculty, students and staff have collectively made significant investments of time and funding to develop new educational approaches, and itâ€™s really important that we get this right.

## 2) Complete course transformations

**EOSC 211** (~100 students): See our [EOSC211 page](crs-eosc211.md) for details. Componets include converting everything from MatLab to Python, incorporating autograding using nbGrader, establishing workflows suitable for managing ~120 students, maintaining content, assignments and labs using GitHub and Jupyter books, and piloting UBC's new open Jupyter Hub (including workarounds when it fails to meet students' needs).

**DSCI 100** (~70) See our [DSCI 100 page](crs-dsci100.md) for  details. This is a complete adaptation of this R-based course to Python, including adapting the custom textbook, all worksheets, assignments and their autograding capabilities, and lecture materials.

**EOSC 442** (~40) All four computing labs were converted from MatLab to Python and piloted by the teaching assistant who runs those labs - Ben O'Connor. See our [EOSC 442 page](crs-eosc442.md) for  details.

## 3) Development of specific data-oriented interactive learning resources

NOTE: See our [dashboards page](dashboards.md) for dashboard apps that were developed and implemented in these courses during this project period.

**ENVR 300** (~50): Several dashboards successfully piloted in yr1 are being refined for use in 2021W2 and others are being considered.

**EOSC 340** (~110): two new sophisticated [dashboard apps](dashboards.md) were completed and will be tested in the January-April term. These two apps draw upon the CMIP6 data sets to help students gain familiarity with the comparison of climate models. Question banks have been prepared in the last few terms using the [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.org/) system.

**EOSC 429**: Dashboard apps, or possibly interactive Jupyter notebooks, are being prepared for students to explore specific concepts in groundwater contamination. To be piloted in January 2023.
