# EOSC 310

## Official course description

**The Earth and the Solar System**: The Earth as a planet: its composition, internal dynamics, and surface evolution. Rotation, magnetic field, plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes. The ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere as components of a varying geo-environment. Not for credit in the Faculties of Science and Applied Science. No background in science or mathematics is required.

## OCESE project objectives

Enable students to "play" with the "daisy world" model and explore 

## Resources produced

These are open education resources (OER) unless indicated otherwise.

Dashboard app [Daisyworld](dashboards.md) was developed by Teaching Assistant F. Rossmann and deployed during the Fall 2021 term. It's description is:

> _The interactive Daisyworld model plots the evolution of (a) the equilibrium temperature of the planet's surface and (b) the proportion of the planetary surface is populated by daisies, all as a function of time in units of "generations" of daisies)._
<br><br>
_Part 1 (Tab 1) considers a planet orbiting a star that is outputting a constant solar flux with time._
<br>
_Part 2 (Tab 2) considers how the equilibrium state of the planet changes when the amount of solar energy absorbed by the planet changes with time._
<br><br>
_Using the sliders you can adjust the planet's distance from the Sun (part 1 only), the albedos of white and black daisies, the albedo of the bare planetary surface, and the planet's insulation factor to explore how each factor will influence the planetary climate response._

The app looks like this:
