# Fixes needed to documentation
No particular order.

* Project data: using the [Accomplishments G-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102730173326762252425), add relevant data or items to each J-Book course page.
* Is a [Project data](project-data.md) summary page needed?
* specific courses: update pages for
   * eosc442,
   * atsc301,
   * 211,
   * envr 420,
   * eosc329,
   * others?
* project evaluation: include some COVID comments.
* github and workflows to be rewritten as summaries based on the [Atlasian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
* Jupyter NB startup needs updating to use material from eosc442 and dsci100 material. How does this compare to docs used in EOSC 211?
* Faculty Pro-D page needs content.
* Dashboards page may need links updated.
* Progress at May 2022 needs content.
* Tools page: clarify what's needed, maybe make sub-pages.
