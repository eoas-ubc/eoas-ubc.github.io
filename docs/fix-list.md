# Fixes to documentation

No particular order.

See also **[issues](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas-ubc.github.io/issues)** at the host repository, **[requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DL2YDthzEbZijx35nVyveSstU5frQdzA/edit#gid=173746334)** (Google sheet) for each project component, and **[accomplishments & data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit#gid=979565415)** (Google sheet) for project outcomes.

* Showcase material is needed for EOAS faculty, Feb/Mar 2023. See the [Accomplishments G-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102730173326762252425) in which materials suitable for OER & showcase are flagged. Permission from instructors should be obtained.
* Project data: using the [Accomplishments G-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102730173326762252425), add relevant data or items to each J-Book course page.
* More about open-source, with examples - pangeo, SimpEG, Fatiango, geosci.xyz, (find ocgy and atsc examples), Jupyter books (again, referring to UBC's examples) etc. justifying especially for earth sciences. Also recommendations for raising awareness with open.ubc.ca.
* OER aspects need a special section - listing courses and resources. Eg PA's and RW's climate physics course.
  * Home page states explicitly that:
    * This book is powered by JupyterBook, and aims to be all of the following:
    * self-reproducing (most figures are self-generating in the notebooks)
    * free and open (permissive license, sources and content available through github)
    * interactive (integration with JupyterHub and Binder will allow readers to run and modify code examples)
    * a living document (content will continue to evolve, and collaboration is welcome)
  * See discussion with Will Engle and Erin Field, 230116, including pointers to template for metadata, UBC OER information, and others. 
  * EOAS website should have a OER's listed somehow, either separately, or on course pages, or maybe both.
  * Licensing and preparing to be open ed resources. The list of accomplishments flags those that could or should be OERs, and see OneNote notes for pointers and recommendations from the meeting with Will Engle and Erin Field on 230116.
  * Add DSCI100 python text as one of the opensource resources.
  * What model for housing & maintaining dashboards - can we use open.ubc.ca? Or will it be Compstaff?
* Jupyter resources & guidelines.
  * Jupyter NB startup needs updating to use material from eosc442 and dsci100 material. How does this compare to docs used in EOSC 211? Should [Project Pythia's foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) be used instead?
  * Jupyter / Python install based on EOSC 211 (and maybe EOSC 354). Does this include use of condalock?
  * github and workflows to be rewritten as summaries, perhaps based on (or simply pointing to?) the [Atlasian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows). Maybe also refer to [Ch.12 of the DSCI100 text](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/version-control.html) (still wiht R as context, but updates in progress).
  * Sources related to Jupyter notebooks etc. include
    * pangeo [weekly meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRerhoxG-wOvh-wQTj7F8HPYve75l8pAtL-tgtzY_3YLqVUsaMSEgE4K70HgMt5S91FMwSu8EIizewy/pub)
    * The also have a [discourse site](https://discourse.pangeo.io/), but that’s probably overkill for us:
    * Also a [pangeo blog](https://medium.com/pangeo): and the [pangeo showcase archive](https://pangeo.io/pangeo-showcase.html)
    * [ARC](https://arc.ubc.ca/about-arc/arc-team)
    * [Project Pythia's foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) and [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) into guidelines & resources.
  * Jupyter Hubs
    * What options and choices. Needs PA's input. Refer to 2i2c's documentation.
    * hubs and Jupyter notebook vs emerging Jupyter lab? This might need no more than a mention of this evolution as an example of the "moving target" for instructors. Notebook has been "sunset" - being replaced with a one-page version of lab.
    * add jupytext to documentation. Needs remarks in several places - setting up notebooks, using notebooks for teaching, and likely others.
  * How did OCESE contribute to DSCI 100:
    * notes from Lindsey
    * capture the slack thread. Done to Jan 6, 2023, file "dsci100-slack-230106.xlsx".
* EOSC 211
  * Add piazza data to eosc211
  * e211's startup docs, lock files and how-tos or tutorials.
* specific courses: update pages for
  * eosc442,
  * atsc301,
  * eosc211,
  * eosc429
  * eosc471
  * eosc373 (describe actions and outcomes with Hal's JNB)
  * others?
* Faculty Pro-D page needs more content.
* Progress at Nov 2022 needs writing.
* Tools page: clarify what's needed, maybe make sub-pages.
* JNB deployment options - pros and cons. The [Servers and hubs](cloud-servers.md) page?
