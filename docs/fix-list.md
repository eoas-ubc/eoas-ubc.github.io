# Fixes needed to documentation
No particular order.

* Project data: using the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102730173326762252425), include relevant data on each course page, and summarize on the [Project data](project-data.md) page.
* specific courses: update eosc442, atsc301, hubs for 211, explain envr 420, eosc329, others?
* project evaluation: include some COVID comments.
* github and workflows to be rewritten as summaries based on the [Atlasian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
* Jupyter NB startup needs updating to use material from eosc442 and dsci100 material. Target EOSC 211.
* Faculty Pro-D page needs content.
* Dashboards page may need links updated.
* Progress at May 2022 needs content.
* Tools page: clarify what's needed, maybe make sub-pages.
