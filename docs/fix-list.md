# Further actions to consider

## Ideas

* Construct PDF via DOCX of the complete site.
* ToDo for PA?
  * Revisit first-year accomplishments, including [md2canvas](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/md2canvas), AL's tutorials, and others. The [projects page](https://github.com/orgs/eoas-ubc/projects/1), and list of repositories may reveal items that need including or summarizing. Needs a walk-through with Phil.
  * add to ATSC301 page?
  * update status on two CMIP dashboards.
* Should we be using an EOAS or UBC-based Github organization for OCESE repositories [UBC GitHub instructor guide](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/github-instructor-guide/)? Should we gather repositories with PA, FJ, JB, IS and collect at eoas-ubc? Maybe start by using tags (i.e. "topics") in FJ's GitHub account.
* Apply lessons learned to **offer workshops via CTLT** on:
  * dashboard development;
  * incorporating dashboards and other interactive opensource resources into learning;
  * opensource resources: building, contributing, using.

## Regarding dashboards

* new / updated dashboards
  * "**ozone**" dashboard to the collection. Maybe envr300 or others can use it?
  * **image annotation app**: needs a page, and explanation. Iddo's repo. This doesn't really address a specific OCESE goal, but it is an attempt to reproduce the LiterallyCanvas approach with is no longer supported. Although it does still work. See sketch examples on the EOAS website at 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  * **Ogata Banks**; eosec429 - needs to be demo'd with Roger.
  * **ocgy** - Rich P had a suggestion: lines between dots to identify cruises. See email 231120. He suggests a student might be able to fix that up.
  * Add **licensing** info to each (CC with details).
  * remove dashboard feedback links (global temperatures, and maybe others).
* need a clear statement of responsibility - from Philippe? Compstaff? And where are documentation, and what permissions are needed?
* maintenance commitment? add a note to dashboards page to contact help desk with problems?
* List candidates for OER, especially via SERC. Note they review but it takes time. First review https://oer.open.ubc.ca/ for ways this collection can be used.
* other ideas:
  * Build use-cases for each relevant course?
  * Explore [JB's cmip6 book?](https://github.com/fhmjones/cmip6_book),
  * review project notes about dashboards (FJ's OneNote).
  * build SERC resources? See ENVR 300 below.
  * Do SERC resources (eg EDDIE) inspire other dashboards?
* explore stand-alone apps - via PyIinstaller? See for example [here](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/7608/python-executable-standalone-application/).
