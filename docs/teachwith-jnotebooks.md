# Teaching and learning with Jupyter Notebooks

## Introduction

This page summarizes ways that Jupyter notebooks have been introduced to EOAS faculty and students for teaching and learning purposes. Detailed guidelines, and examples of uses from various courses, will be provided in separate pages.

**Getting started:** Guidelines for setting up you local computer to run Jupyter Notebooks are in our [Jupyter Notebooks startup](jnotebooks-startup.md) page.

## Developing programming skills with J-Notebooks

* DSCI 100
* EOSC 211
* EOSC 354
* ATSC 303

## Demonstrating concepts without programming

Applications of Jupyter notebooks in which students use the notebooks but will not be doing any actual programming.

* EOSC 350

## Delivering Jupyter notebooks to students

See [this post](https://simpeg.discourse.group/t/best-practice-of-delivering-jupyter-notebooks-to-students/78) from Dikun Yan with answer by Lindsey the simpeg discourse group. (To be superceded.)
