# OCESE - Open-source Computing for Earth Science Education

TThe OCESE project (2020 through 2023) aims to transform teaching in the [UBC Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca) (EOAS) to use open source tools, particularly [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org) organized as [executable books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/).

**Formal title:** Embedding Open-source Computational Tools into the Quantitative Earth Science Specializations

**Project funding:** [The UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund](https://tlef.ubc.ca/funded-proposals/entry/714/), and internal support from the Department - EOAS.

**Project GitHub repository**: The main project repository is [here](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas_tlef).

**Source:** This website's [repository](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas-ubc.github.io) contains Markdown content that is converted to HTML by [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and pushed for online display using [ghp-import](https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/). Most recent update is 2022/04/11.

**Website Organization:** Sections are somewhat inspired by a [documentation framework](https://documentation.divio.com/) described at Divio.

* "PROJECT & OUTCOMES" contains explanations of project goals and summaries of outcomes and deliverables.
* "HOW-TO GUIDES" includes succinct summaries of tools and techniques to help contributors, instructors and students.
* "TUTORIALS" contain more thorough learning resources for students or instructors.
* "REFERENCES" are lists of pointers, links and key sources.
