# OCESE project outcomes summary

## 1. OCESE PROJECT GOALS
**Two primary goals**: Develop open-source computational tools and techniques that will …

1. …increase exposure to quantitative aspects of Earth Science in EOAS core and service courses,
2. …enhance computational & numerical capabilities of EOAS students in core EOAS courses.

**Five goals in support of the top two:**

3. Teaching and learning support for instructors and TAs.
4. Document resources, guidelines, tutorials,
5. Test affordable, sustainable cloud computing options,
6. Support the FoS minor in Data Science and DSCI 100
7. Introduce resulting materials and practices as Open Education Resources

### Explaining "outcome types"
OCESE work has generated over 100 products to date. Of these, over 30 should become Open Education Resources, either individually or as collections. The main types of products or items are:

* **Data** gathered from or about students in 6 courses for feedback on dashboards or JNBs. Other data include discussion threads (TAs, instructors & developers), midterm course feedback, and surveys about prior knowledge & needs during COVID.
* **Support with EOAS**
  * The work of improving all 25 courses included consulting with corresponding instructors and teaching assistants about content, activities, and/or assessments.
  * Additional consulting on pedagogy, logistics, data gathering or tutorials & guidelines was carried out with instructors or teaching assistants for 16 of these 25 courses.
  * Owing to COVID, workshops and training sessions were not carried out, except in 1-on-1 meetings. However, 3 events were run mostly to introduce OCESE activities, and further workshops and training events will be conducted during the 6 months following the official end of funding.
* **Resources** produced for 8 courses include teaching materials adapted for Python, and instructions on use of JNBs, installing & managing Python, GitHub, and use of dashboards & JNBs for teaching. Although developed initially for specific courses, most are generally applicable.
* **Dashboards** used (or planned) in 10 courses, 5 each core and service. Assignments rely on dashboards in 5 courses, others are used for demonstration, class activities or optional.
* **Dissemination**: progress reports and lessons learned have been shared at 5 UBC teaching and learning events, and at 4 conferences or workshops beyond UBC. More contributions are planned before end of 2023.
* **Python Jupyter Notebooks** were introduced for 8 courses; 6 core EOAS courses plus EOSC442 and DSCI100.

## 4. Summary of project output by _goals_

Each _poduct or contribution_ can also be classified as targeting one of the the seven principle project goals:

Items produced for each course are summarized here by project goals. Numbered goals in columns are the same as those at the top of this page. See more notes about this table below.

<BR>

**1. Quantitative Earth Science for all EOAS students**

Courses aiming to enhance students' engagement with **quantitative concepts** or **datasets** are mostly accessible to students from Departments other than EOAS.

**2. Computing for students pursuing EOAS degrees**

Courses aiming to increase computational and numerical capabilities of EOAS students are considered "core" courses. OCESE contributed towards these courses mostly by supporting introduction of **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks** into student learning.

* Courses in which students install Python and Jupyter on their own computers:

  >ATSC301, EOSC211 (optional), EOSC354, EOSC410/510.

* Courses in which students run notebooks on cloud-based Jupyter hubs (either UBC or 2i2c hubs):

  >DSCI100, EOSC211, EOSC213 (using CoLab), EOSC212 (OCESE not involved), EOSC350, EOSC442, EOSC471 (starting 2024).

Courses in which students use (or will likely use) **coding** as part of learning. Not all had OCESE support. (Based on the Dep't computing needs [s](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lg9wLZYwIHSVyXzFPO3096d8eLvL6oLn9lShOosBBok/edit#gid=0)preadsheet as of March 2023.)

>ATSC301, ATSC409, ENVR420, EOSC211, EOSC212, EOSC213, EOSC353, EOSC354, EOSC410/510, EOSC450, EOSC453, EOSC471, EOSC4xx (climate physics, new 2023/4).

**Aassessments or question management**: the following courses have integrated some aspects of managing, automating or "semi-automating" assessments or develeopment / deployment of question sets.

>ATSC301, DSCI100, EOSC211, EOSC325, EOSC340

**3. Faculty development**

The original project proposal anticipated carrying out facultly professional development with workshops and tutorials. Instead, during COVID, the only information sessions were short online presentations at Department meetings.

However, instructors teaching courses involved in the project received more or less extensive support from project team and teaching assistants while adjustments or resources were being developed.

Now, with the project tasks essentially completed, we anticipate that training for groups of faculty can be expected to occur between May and December 2023.

**4. Training materials and documentation**

Some resources are targeted towards students, some for instructors or teaching assistants and some for all three. All are being accumulated at the website you are viewing now. See also Faculty Development below.

**5. Cloud computing facilities**

Project outcomes associated with implenting cloud computing facilities to host student learning activities are essentially "lessons learned" and documented procedures for deploying or using hubs for Jupyter notebooks or servers for dashboards.

**6. Support development of a python version of DSCI 100**

DSCI100 is taught in the UBC Department of Statistics, but this new Python section was first taught by Prof. L. Heagy of the Dep't of EOAS in winter 2023. This major course adapation involved the following activities carried out between 2021 and 2023.

* Adapting the R-based textbook to Python.
* Adapting all learning worksheets from R to Python.
* Adapting teaching materials (slide decks, classroom materials, etc.) from R to Python.
* Teaching the first "Python cohort" of this course.

**7. Open Source Resources (OERs) and pedagogies**

All dashboards, course content (such as texts) and tutorials, guidelines or other documentation emerging from the OCESE project are expected to be designated as OERs, assuming permission from stake holders is obtained.

Resources that are NOT expected to be designated as OERs include those that have solutions to student work or activities.
