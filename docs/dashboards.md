# Dashboards developed or in progress

**What are "dashboards"**? These are interactive mathematical or data exploration applications hosted online and used in any standard browser. They are used by instructors and students or other learners to explore complex data sets, address problems or assignments, or experiment with challenging concepts. Some design guidelines are provided on a [separate "dashboards how-to" page](dashboards-howto.md).

## Climate science & oceanography:

* **[ocgy-dataviewer](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/ocgy)**: observe and compare trace element and physical properties in the water column at selected locations in the Southern Ocean, the Atlantic and the North Pacific. Github repository is the "ocgy-dataviewer" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used as an assignment in [EOSC 372](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc372) in the Fall term, 2021.

* **[Global temperature](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/globaltemps)**: Contributions of several natural and anthropogenic factors to the global temperature anomaly are plotted for 1880-2005, with short explanations. Sketch interactivity is included. Github repository is the "globaltemp-factors" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used in [EOSC 112](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc11) and [EOSC 326](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc326) in the Fall term, 2021.

* **climate-mind-map**, First draft HTML5 interactivity explored. Github [repo](https://github.com/jamiebyer/climate-mind-map). Instructors want to do a "paper" activity based on these ideas first.

* **[Atmospheric CO2](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/co2mlo)**: Monthly averages at Mauna Loa and the South Pole, with user-defined straight line model for crude predictions. Github repository is the "co2-mlo-spo" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used in [ENVR 300](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/envr300) in Winter term 2021, then updated for Winter term 2022.

* **climate-maunaloa-jnb**, on github at [repo](https://github.com/fhmjones/envr-maunaloa-jnb), a Jupyter Notebook version of CO2 at Mauna Loa with straightline modelling. Uses `ipywidget` library for interactivity instead of `PlotlyDash`.

* **[climate-ozone](https://climate-ozone.herokuapp.com/)** plots 1 year of hourly ozone measurements at Vancouver Airport and Abbotsford. Github repository [here](https://github.com/fhmjones/envr-ozone).

* **[Daisyworld](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/daisy)** displays inhabited area as a function of time when daisyworld parameters are varied. Both constant and varying solar flux situations are modeled. Github repository is the "daisy" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used in [EOSC 310](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc310) in Fall term, 2021.

* **cmip6** (climate): Explore the CMPI6 climate science data sets ... in progress

## Geology and hydrogeology

* **[Storativity](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/store)** compares hydrological storativity of various geologic materials. Github repository is the "store" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used in [EOSC 325](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc325) in Fall term, 2021.

* **[Unconfined-flow](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/hydro)** interactive model of linar ("1D") groundwater flow in an unconfined acquifer between two sources, with surface recharge included. Github repository is the "hydro" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used in [EOSC 325](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc325) in Fall term, 2021.

* **[Drawdown](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/drawdown)** for confined and unconfined acquifers plots 2D drawdown curves for a well in a uniform acquifer with adjustable properties. Github repository is the "drawdown" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used in [EOSC 325](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc325) in Fall term, 2021.

* **[Mohr's circles](https://mohrs.herokuapp.com/)**; plots Mohr's circles and failure envelopes by interactively adjusting stress. Github [repo](https://github.com/fhmjones/mohrs).

## Geophysics or "signals"

* **[timeseries-3signals](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/timeseries)** adjustable parameters illustrating noise and trend on a sinewave, with smoothing. Github repository is the "timeseries" folder [here](https://github.com/phaustin/addon_containers). Initially used in [ENVR 300](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/envr300) in Winter term 2021, then updated for Winter term 2022.

* **timeseries-FFT** (not online). On github at [repo](https://github.com/fhmjones/timeseries-fft); works, but incomplete.

* **[interactive images](https://clickimage.herokuapp.com/)** is an initial experiment exploring how to interact with figures for future dashboards planned for paleontology and other disciplines. Github repo [here](https://github.com/fhmjones/ClickImage).

* **[gpglabs](https://gpg.geosci.xyz/content/appendix/apps.html)** is an extensive collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks illustrating concepts in applied geophysics including forward & inverse modeling and physics. See the [GPG applied geophysics textbook](https://gpg.geosci.xyz/) or the interactive NoteBooks collection [repository](https://github.com/geoscixyz/gpgLabs), both with links for running NoteBooks using Binder, Azure Notebooks, or locally on your own computer.
