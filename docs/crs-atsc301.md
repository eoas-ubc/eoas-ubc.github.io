## OCESE project objectives

Apply lessons learned prior to start of OCESE by the instructor P. Austin, who is also lead and principle developer for OCESE.

## Actions taken

All resources and teaching tactics listed here were introduced by Dr. P. Austin prior to OCESE project as his "normal" approach to teaching this course. Experiences preparing for, and teaching this course have served as precedent for actions and decisions throughout the OCESE project. All resources are open education resources (OER) unless indicated otherwise.

* JNBs and Python programming are integral to learning throughout.
* Jupyter books about Python, programming and course content. Some are used or adapted from open sources, others built by the instructor.
* Students gain initial experiences with opensource practices (GitHub).
* Questions or question sets are managed via the Canavas API.
* Address challenges related to having students use opensource - and sometimes very large - datasets (eg satellite imagery).

## Instructors' experiences

## Students' experiences

## Costs

Running this course assumes significant experience with Python, Jupyter notebooks, Jupyter Books and opensource (GitHub) practices.

The OCESE project did not explicitly improve aspects of ATSC301 but it has served an important role as precedent for many resources and teaching or learning tactics introduced in other courses.

The "costs" have all been instructor time to maintain the existing resources and learning activities, and to document them sufficiently to transfer the course to a new instructor in the future.

A custom Jupyter hub is currently required because "standard" hubs provided at open.jupyter.ubc are not flexible enough to define and update environments regularly during the course, and they are unable to handle large remote sensing datasets reqauired by course.

## Lessons Learned

It is beneficial to including explicit learning goals associated with the practicalities of programing and working in the open source domain.

Optimal solutions are still being established for a Jupyter hub that can efficiently sustain the requirements for flexibility, and manage access to large data sets.
