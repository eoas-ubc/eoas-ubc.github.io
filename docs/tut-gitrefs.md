|3|**[7-part intro. to Git](https://www.neonscience.org/version-control-git-series)** from NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network).|written tutorial website|Succinct, no extra words, includes objectives; very nice. Somewhat derived from Software Carpentry (next item). Includes updating repos via "remote".|
|4|**[Git 101 basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBg9mlpzEYU)**|Youtube video (33 mins but play at 1.75 time)|I learned more from this than most other sources, and have watched it several times.|
|5|**[Software carpentry's resources](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)** for their hands on workshops.|Well organized website|Includes a workshop schedule, pages for each section & exercises. A bit more wordy than NEON's introduction, but well designed and tested.|

|10|**[LinkedIn Learning "courses"](https://linkedinlearning.ubc.ca)** for UBC faculty and staff|Video courses|Log in using your CWL and search for Git, or GitHub, etc. There are many, but at least they are not quite as random as the unfiltered internet.|
