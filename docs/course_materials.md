# Courses

This section consists of individual pages outlining intentions and outcomes for each course targeted by the OCESE project.

Some courses were significantly transformed in terms of pedagogy, resources, and/or content.

Other courses were affected on smaller scales by introducing one or more interactive dashboard apps, supporting provision of cloud computing hubs (e.g. for running Jupyter Notebooks), or by generating guidelines or documentation for installing Python, Jupyter, or other opensource computing facilities.

Find details about work done for each course using the left-side menu.
