# Courses

These sections outline the intentions and outcomes for each course affected by the OCESE project.

Some courses were significantly transformed in terms of pedagogy, resources, and/or content.

Other courses were impacted on smaller scales by introducing one or more interactive dashboard apps, helping instructors introduce new learning activities, coordinating computing hubs (e.g. for running Jupyter Notebooks), evaluating impacts of innovations, or by generating guidelines for installing Python, Jupyter, or other opensource computing facilities.

Where feasible the course impact summaries include comments on these aspects:

* Goals: intended improvements, and why;
* Actions taken
* students’ experiences;
* instructors’ experiences;
* costs & steps to design, build, test, deploy, & evaluate;
* lessons learned and next steps if any.
