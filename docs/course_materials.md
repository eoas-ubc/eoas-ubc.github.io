# Courses

These sections outline the intentions and outcomes for each course targeted by the OCESE project.

Some courses were significantly transformed in terms of pedagogy, resources, and/or content.

Other courses were affected on smaller scales by introducing one or more interactive dashboard apps, helping instructors introduce new learning activities, coordinating computing hubs (e.g. for running Jupyter Notebooks), evaluating impacts of innovations, or by generating guidelines for installing Python, Jupyter, or other opensource computing facilities.
