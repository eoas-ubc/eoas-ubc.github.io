# Project Evaluation and Wisdom gained

See the evaluation [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sy_qDbaRvyyFw2NM8jc_0Xge2LpbL2Cxb9cFv9dQKxE/edit) at the TLEF project support site.

## Evaluation questions, Data, Results and Implications

## Lessons learned

### Faculty participation

1) When we offer to build dashboards, several instructors were keen but slow to participate. (eg Mohr’s Circle app, ENVR 300 in fall 2021, hydrogeology.
2) Three were produced for EOSC325. There was good engagement early on, considering we didn’t get apps onto servers until late in the design cycle.
3) Fine tuning for actual use in class didn’t happen until very near the actual use.
   1) Ocgy was being reviewed and a corresponding assignment developed 3 weeks before implementation.
   2) Eosc325 was being reviewed and fine tuned just days before final use.
4) Conclusions / recommendations:
   1) Try to get instructors in the design cycle as early as possible – eg use Heroku.
   2) Make sure app is deployed at least 2weeks before planned use in class or assign.

### Dashboards; general lessons learned

1. Instructors need time to explore, play, and iterate on learning activities.

2. Assignments need to establish expectations or purposes. Add a single learning goal (or two if it’s a longer assignment) to the assignment (not directly on the dashboard.

See separate pages with guidelines for [dashboard development](dashboards-howto.md) and [dashboard deployment](dashboards-deploy.md).
