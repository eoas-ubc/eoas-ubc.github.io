# Documentation for "Standard Practices"

These were prepared for OCESE project participants, instructors and students. There is of course a vast range of documentation, tutorials and guidelines "out there" in the form of web resources, Jupyter books, intereactive tutorials and videos. Some are referenced in these docs, but be sure to use "creative googling" to find details not included in these documents.
