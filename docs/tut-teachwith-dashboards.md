# Teaching and learning with Dashboards

## Introduction

This page summarizes ways that dashboards have been introduced to EOAS faculty and students for teaching and learning purposes. Design and deployment guidelines are provided on separate pages. 

## General feedback about using dashboards in lessons:

* In all the courses using new dashboards we are seeing the same importance of allowing students time to familiarize with the tool before asking them to make good use of it. Students cannot solve problems with a new tool unless they have time to familiarize with the tool. There are 3 aspects they are wrestling with: 1) new concepts, 2) a new tool, and 3) a "problem" to solve (eg "_what happens to the water divide, both mathematically and conceptually_"). 
* If possible, ask them to familiarize with the tool before coming to class, perhaps with a few pointers about what to look for. Then they will come to class more ready to use the tool productively.
* Or, have them explore a little in class at the end of one lesson, then pick up the "real" task in the following lesson.
* Perhaps the first questions they are given can be "trivial" (i.e. more about the tool than the concepts). Then the real problem you want them to solve comes after that.
* Activity instructions on lecture slides can work for inclass work. However, it is more effective to have a worksheet with settings, questions, and spaces for answering. 
* Questions to solve can be more "interesting" to students (i.e. more motivational) if they are in terms of the consequences to people, property, ecosystems, or whatever, rather than simply abstract or theoretical questions. This is about connecting concepts to reality.
