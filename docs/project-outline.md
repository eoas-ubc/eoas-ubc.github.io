# OCESE Project Outline

This is the front page of an ongoing project to transform teaching in the [UBC Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/) (EOAS) to use open source tools, particularly [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org/) organized as [executable books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/).

**Formal title**: Embedding Open-source Computational Tools into the Quantitative Earth Science Specializations

## Project Goals

Using open source, cloud-based computing we aim to integrate computational and quantitative skills more comprehensively and consitently across our Department's curriculum, incorporating real world examples and datasets into existing courses. New Jupyter notebook based modules and activities will be threaded throughout core courses in Geophysics, Atmospheric Sciences, Oceanography and Geological Engineering bridging traditional disciplinary boundaries.

This proposed curriculum transformation will happen alongside a re-evaluation of quantitative EOAS course offerings across disciplines. The end result will reposition the UBC Earth Science specializations as opportunities for quantitative and computational learning in a highly interdisciplinary domain.

## Progress

Progress as of November 2020 is summarized [here](progress-nov2020.md). Work underway is tracked on our [project board](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas_tlef/projects/2)
