# Goals and Contributors

This is the front page of an ongoing project to transform teaching in the [UBC Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/) (EOAS) to use open source tools, particularly [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org/) organized as [executable books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/).

**Formal title**: Embedding Open-source Computational Tools into the Quantitative Earth Science Specializations

## Project Goals

Using open source, cloud-based computing we aim to integrate computational and quantitative skills more comprehensively and consitently across our Department's curriculum, incorporating real world examples and datasets into existing courses. New Jupyter notebook based modules and activities will be threaded throughout core courses in Geophysics, Atmospheric Sciences, Oceanography and Geological Engineering bridging traditional disciplinary boundaries.

This proposed curriculum transformation will happen alongside a re-evaluation of quantitative EOAS course offerings across disciplines. The end result will reposition the UBC Earth Science specializations as opportunities for quantitative and computational learning in a highly interdisciplinary domain.

### Principles

- _Tara Ivanochko_: Project P.I. ([TI at EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/taraivanochko)). Dr. Ivanochko has been Associate Head Undergraduate Affairs in EOAS; Director of the Environmental Science BSc Degree specialization, and is currently serving as Academic Director, UBC Sustainability Initiative (USI).

- _Phil Austin_: Project instigator and chief developer. ([PA at EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/philaustin) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/phaustin)). Dr. Austin has transformed three courses to use python and Jupyter notebooks and is the liaison between this proposal and UBC's other related data science education projects. He is also engaged with the Faculty of Science initiative to provide student computation support on the cloud and chair of the Infrastructure Sub-committee for the Faculty of Science Data Science Committee.

- _Francis Jones_: Coordinator, admin and development. ([FJ at EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/francisjones) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/fhmjones)). Mr. Jones has taught geophysics in UBC's Department of EOAS for 25 yrs and has worked in the department as a geoscience education specialist since 2007.

- _Lindsey Heagy_: Geophysics / datascience professor with direct experience in tools and techniques, and with an ongoing stake as instructor for several courses we are working on. ([LH at EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/lindseyheagy) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/lheagy)).
