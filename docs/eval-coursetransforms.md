# Evaluation: Course transformations

The OCESE project contributed more or less time, personnel and expertise to help convert these courses from using MatLab or R to Python. Spome of the 3rd and 4th year courses are more flexible, allowing students to work in alternative programming environments, but Python is growing in popularity as the preferred environment for the majority of students.

See details about goals and accomplishments on separate pages for courses that the following "transformed" courses:

* [DSCI 100](crs-dsci100.md), Introduction to Data Science
* [EOSC 211](crs-eosc211.md), Computer Methods in Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences
* [EOSC 354](crs-eosc354.md), Analysis of Time Series and Inverse Theory for Earth Scientists
* [EOSC 442](crs-eosc442.md), Climate Measurement and Analysis
* [EOSC 410](crs-eosc410.md), Geoscientific Data Analysis and Empirical Modelling
