# Teaching and learning with Jupyter Notebooks

## Introduction

This page summarizes ways that Jupyter notebooks have been introduced to EOAS faculty and students for teaching and learning purposes. Detailed guidelines, and examples of uses from various courses, will be provided in separate pages.

**Getting started:** Guidelines for setting up you local computer to run Jupyter Notebooks are in our [Jupyter Notebooks startup](jnotebooks-startup.md) page.

## Developing programming skills with J-Notebooks

* DSCI 100
* EOSC 211
* EOSC 354
* EOSC 442
* ATSC 303

## Demonstrating concepts without programming

Applications of Jupyter notebooks in which students use the notebooks but will not be doing any actual programming.

* EOSC 350

## Developing data science skills

* teaching data visualization techniques: legibility, visual hierarchy, and appropriate use of color. Precedent in [Hepworth et al., 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10899995.2019.1656022).

## Delivering Jupyter notebooks to students

* When nbgrader is NOT being used.
* when nbgrader IS being used.

Compare deployment options for JNBs. See [for example](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-colab-vs-jupyter-notebook/) a May 2020 comparison of local and Google Colab options. Include...

  * who to ask for advice and support.
  * necessary resources and "start up" costs for students.

There is an ever-increasing plethora of specific notebooks or notebook collections for teaching and learning specific subjects. Examples include:
