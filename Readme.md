# OCESE documentation website

Goal is to accumulate in one place all project outcomes and guidelines for instructors and students who use these outcomes.

## Website Organization:

Sections are inspired by a [documentation framework](https://documentation.divio.com/) described at Divio.

* “PROJECT & OUTCOMES” will contain explanations of project **goals** and summaries of **outcomes** and **deliverables**.
* “HOW-TO GUIDES” will include **succinct summaries** of tools and techniques to help contributors, instructors and students.
* “TUTORIALS” contain **more thorough learning resources** for students or instructors.
* “REFERENCES” will be lists of pointers, links and key sources, including **cheatsheets** we have found useful.
