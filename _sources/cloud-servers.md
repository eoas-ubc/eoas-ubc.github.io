# Servers and hubs

This page to explain how to set up Jupyter hubs on local, institutional or cloud servers.

For deploying dashboards, see the [Dashboard deployment](dashboards-deploy.md) pages.

## Options

### 1. CoLab
Used by EOSC 213.

**Pros** (google it)

**Cons**

Pertinent quote:  "if you're not paying for the product, you are the product"

* Tied to Google account (notebooks are saved to GDrive).
* No warranties, no service, no support, no security.
* Not a Canadian server (also, the service is governed by US laws).
* No UBC course can *require* students to access accounts on US servers -- it has to be *opt in* and students can decline.  So you have to be ready to supply a backup server for students.
* Similarly we (UBC) can not *require* that a student have a Google account. 
* More constraints at https://colab.one/terms-of-use.
* Google kills projects, and we don't want to be left unable to run a course if they kill or curtail their facilities. See https://killedbygoogle.com/.
* Some courses need more speed or RAM or CPU's or persistent storage in the cloud coupled to the code.
* Some courses need custom environments (i.e. libraries).
* Some UBC courses want Julia, R, or other kernels.
* Also, see for example some disadvantages [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-disadvantages-of-using-Google-Colab))
