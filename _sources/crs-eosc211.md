# EOSC 211

## Official description

**Computer Methods in Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences**: Mathematical computer-based problem solving in the physical, chemical, and biological sciences. Problems drawn from studies of the earth, the oceans and the atmosphere.

## OCESE project goals for EOSC 211

* Convert all MatLab teaching and learning materials to Python
* Convert all MatLab classroom and homework exercises to Python
* Implement the course website using Jupyter Books.
* Include weekly instructions and labs/assignments as Jupyter Notebooks. (See resources below).
* Implement automatic grading practices using the Jupyter Notebook plugin [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader).
* Adapt open source materials to make a suitable text book for programming (and Python) beginners.
* Establish stable, sustainable Jupyter Hub facilities at UBC for with reliable tech-support for instructors and teaching assistants.

## Actions taken

* [EOSC211 course website](https://phaustin.github.io/eosc211_students/announcements.html), a **Jupyter Book** including calendar of topics, links into relevant sections of the text book, and assignments & labs provided as **Jupyter Notebooks**.
* [Text book](https://phaustin.github.io/Problem-Solving-with-Python/), mainly python programming for beginners. Adapted from [Problem Solving with Python-37](https://github.com/professorkazarinoff/Problem-Solving-with-Python-37-Edition) by Dr. Peter Kazarinof.
* Jupyter Notebooks with Python code exercises and activities for classwork.
* Getting-started instructions for students to install Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Windows or Mac laptops. This was done with 90 students in one  1.5-hour lecture session.
* A [Jupyter Hub tutorial](tut-jhubs.md) for EOSC211 students, but easily generalized. This also serves as the first introduction to coding with Python.
* Grading is accomplished using nbgrader.
* Restricted **Canvas** site for delivery and submission of assignments, assignment data sets, and other course content.
 * UBC open Jupyter hub piloted (fall 2022).
   * _Refer to hub feedback in file (221209-HubFeedback.xlsx)_.

## Instructors' experiences

### a) Necessary instructor and TA skills

* Maintain the text (Jupyter book).
* Maintain Jupyter notebooks used for class, lab and homework.
* Manage assignment update, delivery, collection, grading & feedback cycle.
* Run labs and promote paired-programming.

### b) Workflow for preparing and delivering lessons

### c) Workflow for preparing and delivering labs & assignments

### d) Assessment tactics

* Question preparation including delivery to Canvas.
* Question types
* Grading: nbgrader used in Sept 2021. Will that be replaced by PrairieLearn?

## Students' experiences

### a) Questions, data, results

* Compare student success using Python to earlier using similar questions in assignments, labs and exams.
* Instructor interview: eg, what is working well? What are 'pain points'? What needs fixing or improving?
  * notes from "installfest feedback"
* TA interview: same questions as instructors.
* What student feedback is available? What do they say?
  * midterm survey with ~100% response rate: MC and open questions. Summarized.
  * Standard UBC end of term "Student Experience of Instruction" survey.

## Costs, Risks, and Recommendations

* Auto-grading is essential. Prior to Python (i.e. before 2021) MatLab was the language and grading involved custom MatLab parsing code by R. Pawlowicz.
* Two Jupyter books (course book and "text book") need a server and ability to maintain the markdown and the server.
