    "\n",
    "This tutorial is from the first lab exercise in the course [EOSC 211](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc211). It includes cells in which students write their first bits of *Python* code, explore some of the features of *Jupyter Notebooks*, and learn how to save and submit your work for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on a website that has a \"rocketship icon\" in the top right hand corner of the screen, clicking it will launch ***JuptyerHub*** - if such functionality is enabled. After signing in, Jupyterhub will open an interactive copy of the notebook which you can edit, download, and submit for grading if that's relevant. \n",

    "#### Why Python/Jupyterhub?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a *high level programming language,* meaning it is comparatively easy for humans to read. Python programs are executed by a *python interpreter,* which takes python code, reads it into a processor (the CPU on your computer, or in our case, a Jupyterhub server) and returns a result. This process is repeated over and over for each line of code, often taking the result of one line and feeding it into the next. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also *open source*, meaning there are no fees to download/use python, and anyone is free to add to the Python code base. This is a major reason for Python's growing popularity in the scientific community, there are many add ons (called *packages*) developed by other scientists specifically for the type of programming we want to do in this course, with more being added every day!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks** are an IDE, or *integrated development environment* which have gained popularity amoung the science community for processing data, creating scientific figures, solving numerical equations, and sharing code. IDE's are essentially advanced text editors containing features helpful for writing code (if you really wanted to, you could write all your code in Notepad or Microsoft Word then copy/paste it into a python interpreter somewhere, but we strongly recommend *not* doing this). \n",
    "\n",
    "**JupyterHub** is a *computational environment* for running jupyter notebooks in the cloud, designed specifically for applications like teaching or collaborative research. The EOSC211 course hub is available online and requires no installation on your own machine. Later in the course, we will talk about installing python yourself, creating your own *environments*, and developing your own individual workflow."
