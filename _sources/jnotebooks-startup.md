# Setting up Jupyter Notebooks

Guidelines pointed to below will help you to set up your local computer from scratch, so that you can start the **Jupyter Notebook** facility from the command line, then run or edit code or comments in any `*.ipynb` file.

## The sequence of steps

1. Be sure you can navigate your computer's folders using PowerShell (on Windows) or Bash (on Mac).
2. Install the open-source package-management system and environment-management system called `miniconda`.
3. Install the Jupyter software.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook program to edit and execute "Jupter Notebooks" in your default browser.
