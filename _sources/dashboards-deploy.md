# Dashboard deployment

Three types of deployment are described succinctly:

1. Setting up a PC to view a dashboard locally.
2. Deploying to the free (although limited) Heroku service.
3. Installing to a managed server for scalable use my many users.

Deploying to a commercial or institutional clou-basedd server may be described later.
