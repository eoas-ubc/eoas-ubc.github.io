# ENVR 300

## Official description

**Introduction to Research in Environmental Science**: Students investigate research methodologies and reporting in a range of scientific disciplines and fields. See the [EOAS course page](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/envr300) and [UBC Calendar](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=ENVR&course=300) for details.

## OCESE project objectives

Introduce interactive dashboard apps to classroom and assignment activities to explore concepts and data sets. 

* [Atmospheric CO_2 at Mauna Loa and South Pole](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/co2mlo) (monthly averages), with user-defined straight line model for crude predictions. See the [Dashboards page](./dashboards.md) for links to repositories.
* [Three signals](https://dashboard.eoastest.xyz/timeseries): adjustable parameters illustrating noise and trend on a sinewave, with smoothing. Signals, trends, noise and smoothing: a simple interactive dashboard app. to gain familiarity with interactions of these components of signals.

## Open resources

* Dashboard code repositories above.
