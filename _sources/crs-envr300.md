## OCESE project objectives

Introduce interactive dashboard apps to classroom and assignment activities to explore concepts and data sets.

## Resources produced

* [Atmospheric CO_2 at Mauna Loa and South Pole](https://dashboard.eoas.ubc.ca/co2mlo) (monthly averages), with user-defined straight line model for crude predictions.
* [Three signals](https://dashboard.eoas.ubc.ca/timeseries): adjustable parameters illustrating noise and trend on a sinewave, with smoothing. Signals, trends, noise and smoothing: a simple interactive dashboard app. to gain familiarity with interactions of these components of signals.
* Links to repositories are on the project's [dashboards page](./dashboards.md).

## Pedagogy

### a) Necessary instructor and TA skills

* Maintain dashboards and accompanying resources.
* Manage assignment update, delivery, collection, grading & feedback cycle.

### b) Workflow for preparing and delivering lessons

In January 2021 the CO_2 dashboard was used as a fully online, in-class group activity. A Google Sheets document was used by groups to submit their work for whole-class discussion. Each group used one slide/page to answer 4 questions and post images captured from the work they've done using a preliminary version of the [Atmospheric CO2 dashboard app](dashboards.md). Here is an example of group work submission onto a single slide.

### c) Workflow for preparing and delivering labs & assignments

### d) Assessment tactics

This was an in-class group activity with group work discussed as followup within the same class timeslot as work was done. Hence no "assessment" of student work.

## Project evaluation

### a) Questions, data, results

Some simple survey questions were included in the activity - student responses are efficient to summarize. These are results from two dashboards; the **Atmospheric CO2** and the **timeseris-3signals** dashboard apps.

The clear positive implication from this small data set is that students found these resources effective and efficient and they want more.

**What was the impact of using this facility on your instructing practice?**

>"_The Google Sheets approach with a slide for each group worked so well that I might use it for normal in-person class work once we're back in classrooms_". (This activity was was first piloted during COVID pandemic in the 3rd week of a fully online, zoom-based class.)

**What did you like about learning with this facility?**

> "_I liked how interactive it is and how we can see how things change when we choose different trends_".

> "_I like that these activities allow me to visualize concepts covered in class._"

> "_I like how interactive the dashboards were and how we were able to learn both individually and in a group simultaneously._"

**Was there anything you disliked about the app?**

> "_It would be helpful to fiddle with the activity individually first (so there's not a lot of silence in the breakout rooms) and then discuss answers with other group members._"

> "_A little time could have been spent introducing the app and the issues (questions) being addressed during the activity._"
