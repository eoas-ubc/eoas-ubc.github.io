# Open Education Resources

* list those produced by OCESE, with links into courses or dashboards pages.

## Creating OERs

* Jupyter books - refer elsewhere
* considerations regarding use or reuse of third party resources.
* procedures for searching - UBC library guidelines.
* procedures for submitting - UBC library contacts.
* other stuff?

## Licensing and establishing OER status

* explore, and reference, UBC's OER resources and people.
* establish metadata for proposed OERs using the UBC Library's OER sharing metadata form - [a Word DOCX table](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/ld.php?content_id=35940107), also at ..\OCESE\docs&reports\OER.
* Also search FJ's OneNote for OER - there are 4 pgs. See especially Jan 16. 2023.
