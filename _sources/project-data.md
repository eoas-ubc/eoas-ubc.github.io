# Data about project progress

See the [project accomplishments spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit#gid=979565415) for a listing of data, data types, the courses and people involved, and some notes on todos or comments.

From that listing, summaries of results (as of Fall 2022) are in Tables 1 and 2.

**Table 1**: Project "products" counted in terms of their "type":

|Types of project accomplishments|# instances|
|-----|:-----:|
|Total no. students in courses directly impacted 2021-2023|~2300|
|No. [courses](course_materials.md) directly impacted by Fall 2022|17|
|No. [faculty](project-outline.md) directly involved or affected|17|
|No. [grad students](project-outline.md) who learned by contributing|9|
|No. [undergrad students](project-outline.md) who learned by contributing|6|
|Teaching / learning resources produced|17|
|Instances of dashboards use in courses|13|
|Consulting activities (i.e. help & support for instructors)|12|
|Teaching & learning strategies developed|12|
|Dissemination: poster, presentation, etc.|8|
|Planned "product", but no activity to date|7|
|Faculty professional development events or items*|6|
|other|0|

\* NOTE that "Faculty professional development events or items" do NOT include all the one-on-one work that naturally accompanies development of new resources, pedagogies or logistics. These ongoing interactions are too numerous to count. See the spreadsheet mentioned above for details.

**Table 2:** Numbers of "products" that targeted the original project goals:

|OCESE project goals|Totals|
|-----|:-----:|
|Enhanced learning of quantitative Earth Science for students in any EOAS course|26|
|Engage with new and existing faculty; Faculty proffsional development|23|
|Enhanced computational / numerical literacy for EOAS graduates|18|
|Total items that could become *Open Ed Resources*, or OERs| 18|
|Items of documentation|13|
|Development / testing of affordable, sustainable cloud computing facilities|8|
|Support the Faculty of Science Minor in Data Science|5|

Keep in mind that individual "products" may be realitively small (such as a single midterm survey used as data) or relatively involved (such as establishing how to deploy and maintain a cloud computing hub for efficient management of dashboards) - or anywhere in between. See the spreadsheet mentioned above for details.
