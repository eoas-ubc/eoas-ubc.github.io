# Communications about OCESE project work

Scholarly contributions are fewer than "normal" owing to constraints experienced between 2020 and 2022.

## Scholarly contributions

Scholarly contributions are fewer than we in EOAS would have expected owing to constraints experienced between 2020 and 2022. Most of the following were delivered at relatively informal events within UBC, but **>>two** were presented as peer-reviewed posters at formal conferences.

1. **>> July 2023**: Jones, F., Austin, P., Invanochko, T. "[Lessons Learned While Implementing Open Source Computational Tools and Practices for Learning Quantitative Earth Sciences"](https://serc.carleton.edu/earth_rendezvous/2023/program/posters/friday/263242.html), Poster at **Earth Educators Rendezvous 2023** meeting, Pasadena, Calif.
2. **May 2022**: P. Austin. "[Creating Inclusion and Accessibility through Data Science: Challenges and Solutions](https://wiki.ubc.ca/images/6/6f/Celebrate_Learning_-_Data_Science_and_Inclusion.pdf)"; Panel discussion, part of UBC's [Celebrate Learning](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Documentation:CTLT_programs/2022-Celebrate_Learning_Week) week.
2. **May 2022**: Project progress report as a poster: [Future-ready computing & quantitative skills; opensource solutions in Earth Science courses](https://tlef2.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2022/05/2022-SCI-Tara-Ivanochko.pdf).
3. **March 2022**: F. Jones, A short EOAS Dep't news item [about dashboards](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/news-events/news/16485372001).
4. **>> Dec 2021**: Jones, F., Schoof, C., Austin, P., Invanochko, T.: "[Reinvigorating Computational & Quantitative undergraduate Curricula for the Earth, Ocean, Atmospheric, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at UBC](https://agu2021fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=2A-C2-3D-E0-3B-DD-9A-5E-A3-C9-44-74-4B-06-45-A9)", **American Geophysical Union** ([AGU](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting-2022)) poster (link may not be permanently available to the public).

5. **May 2021**: UBC TLEF Showcase, [Opensource Computing for Earth Sciences Education: Lessons learned in year 1 of 3](https://tlef2.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2021/05/2021-TLEF-Showcase-SCI-Tara-Ivanochko.pdf).
6. **May 2021**: P. Austing, Pangeo Showcase. <a href="files/austin_pangeo_may_2021.pdf">ÎŸCESE: Open source computing for Warth sciences education</a>. See also [video](https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/may-5-2021-ocese-open-source-computing-for-earth-science-education/1443) of the event.
7. **Sept. 2020**: P. Austin, "[Building an open-source educational community around executable Jupyterbooks](https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/11python/papers/viewonly.cgi?password=582729&username=384767)". American Meteorolgical Society Annual Meeting. 
8. **August 2020**: UBC [Jupyter Days](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/jupyterdays/), [Writing Canvas quizzes with Jupyter](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/jupyterdays/blob/master/jupyterdays/sessions/austin-colclough/md2canvas.md)
9. **July 2020**: Scipy 2020 "BoF" discussion session.

## EOAS or UBC meetings / workshops

1. **December 2020: Dep't mini retreat**. "_OCESE components and progress_". See <a href="files/ocese-demo-dec15.pdf">PDF</a> of presentation slides.
Or: <a href="files/ocese-demo-dec15.pdf">PDF</a>. (this link doesn't work)

   * OCESE project components - which are attractive to you?
   * Faculty feedback
   * OCESE is working on: Jupyter notebooks and books, dashboards (the "low threshold"), auto-grading & connecting with Canvas, Local Jupyter Hubs and corresponding systems & workflows.
   * students and instructors perspectives.
   * infrastructure.

2. **February 2021: participant meeting.** "_Dashboards: Making Concepts interactive_". See <a href="files/Fac-ProD-Feb-210215.pdf">PDF of  presentation slides</a>.
   * Interactive learnign resources - precedent. (Targeting the "low threshold" end of the quantitative learnign spectrum.)
   * Initial examples in EOAS - ENVR 300.
   * Associated pedagogy.
   * Brainstorm to discuss courses, topics, objectives, steps.
   * making dashboards: development steps.

3. **June 2021: Teaching with Jupyter notebooks**
   * Workshop mostly prepared for instructors considering introducing Jupyter notebooks.
   * Not delivered due to reduced level of interest during the "covid summer" of 2021.
