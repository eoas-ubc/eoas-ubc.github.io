# Recommended settings

This is not about "how to" but mainly lists of requirements or summaries of action steps.

## 1. Using `.gitignore`

## 2. Environments

### 2.1 For building Jupyter Books

### 2.2 For creating interactive dashboards

### 2.3 For testing dashboards in Voila

### 2.4 For numerical computing (Python)

## 3. Navigating Git settings

Status, log, remote, upstream & origin, branches, etc. Also the scope of Git settings. (I think that is in and below the folder where the hidden `.git` folder is.)

## 4. Jupyter books

Where to edit, where to post (or "deliver"), other options for maintaining documentation.
