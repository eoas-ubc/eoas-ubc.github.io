||Description|Type|Comments|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|**[7-part intro. to Git](https://www.neonscience.org/version-control-git-series)** from NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network).|written tutorial website|Succinct, no extra words, includes objectives; very nice. Somewhat derived from Software Carpentry (next item). Includes updating repos via "remote".|
|2|**[Git 101 basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBg9mlpzEYU)**|Youtube video (33 mins but play at 1.75 time)|I learned more from this than most other sources, and have watched it several times.|
|3|**[Software carpentry's resources](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)** for their hands on workshops.|Well organized website|Includes a workshop schedule, pages for each section & exercises. A bit more wordy than NEON's introduction, but well designed and tested.|
|4|**[Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc)** and others, from Git.|Manual; book; videos|Detailed documentation and the comprehensive Pro Git book. Four short videos are good introductions.|
|5|**["Best practices" & Git cheat sheet](https://www.jrebel.com/system/files/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)**|PDF page|From a nice (although oldish, 2016) summary by _Rebellabs_ called [Git Cheat Sheet: Commands and Best Practices](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet).|
|6|**[GitHub Forking](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)**|MD page|"Fairly standard" procedure: Create a fork; Do your work; Issue a pull request; Merge back into the original project.|
|7|**[Merging vs. Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)**|Git tutorial page|One of many pages in a comprehensive [Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) from Atlassian.com. Their context is Bitbucket (not GitHub) but Git concepts are the same.|
|8|**[LinkedIn Learning "courses"](https://linkedinlearning.ubc.ca)** for UBC faculty and staff|Video courses|Log in using your CWL and search for Git, or GitHub, etc. There are many, but at least they are not quite as random as the unfiltered internet.|
