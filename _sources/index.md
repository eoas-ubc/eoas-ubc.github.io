# OCESE - Open-source Computing for Earth Science Education

This is the front page of an  ongoing project to transform teaching in the [UBC Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca) to use open source tools, particularly [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org) organized as [executable books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/)

Formal title: Embedding Open-source Computational Tools into the Quantitative Earth Science Specializations

Project funding: [the UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund](https://tlef.ubc.ca/funded-proposals/entry/714/)

+++

## Project goals

Using open source, cloud-based computing we aim to integrate computational and quantitative skills more comprehensively into the EOAS curriculum, incorporating real world examples and datasets into existing courses. New Jupyter notebook based modules and activities will be threaded throughout core courses in Geophysics, Atmospheric Sciences, Oceanography and Geological Engineering bridging traditional disciplinary boundaries. This proposed curriculum transformation will happen alongside a re-evaluation of quantitative EOAS course offerings across disciplines. The end result will reposition the UBC Earth Science specializations as opportunities for quantitative and computational learning in a highly interdisciplinary domain.

## Project organization

During the summer of 2020, we will be working to:

1. Develop a set of tools to make it easier to transition existing courses
   to the new executable notebook format

2. Develop and release introductory material on Jupyter notebooks, python
   and working with git

3. Transition our first courses into the new notebook/markdown framework

Work underway is tracked on our [project board](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas_tlef/projects/2)
