TThe OCESE project (2020 through 2023) aims to transform teaching in the [UBC Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca) (EOAS) to use open source tools, particularly [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org) organized as [executable books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/). Two sections of this website are: 

* "PROJECT COMPONENTS" describing the project and its deliverables;
* "DOCUMENTATION", containing materials to help contributors, instructors and students use the tools and techniques.

**Formal title:** Embedding Open-source Computational Tools into the Quantitative Earth Science Specializations

**Project funding:** [The UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund](https://tlef.ubc.ca/funded-proposals/entry/714/), and internal support from the Department - EOAS.

**Project GitHub repository**: The main project repository is [here](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas_tlef).

**Source:** This website's [repository](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas-ubc.github.io) contains Markdown content that is converted to HTML by [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and pushed for online display using [ghp-import](https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/).
