# Courses

These sections outline the intentions and outcomes for each course affected by the OCESE project.

Some courses were significantly transformed in terms of pedagogy, resources, and/or content.

Other courses were impacted on smaller scales by introducing one or more interactive dashboard apps, helping instructors introduce new learning activities, coordinating computing hubs or servers for running Jupyter Notebooks or dashboards, evaluating impacts of innovations, and/or by generating guidelines for installing Python, Jupyter, and other opensource computing facilities.

Where feasible the course impact summaries include comments on these aspects:

1. Goals: intended improvements, and why;
1. Actions taken
1. Students’ experiences;
1. Instructors’ experiences;
1. Costs: time taken & steps to design, build, test, deploy, & evaluate;
1. Lessons learned and next steps if any.

Courses and essential contributions made by OCESE are summarized in the following table.

|Course|Title|Contributions|Comments|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ATSC301 | Atmospheric Radiation and Remote Sensing  | Python, JNB, Jbooks, GitHub  | All aspects implemented prior to OCESE, so this course served as precedent for OCESE decisions and actions. |
