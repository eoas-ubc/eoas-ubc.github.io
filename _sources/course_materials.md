# Course material

## Getting started

For those just beginning to use Git, GitHub, Jupyter, Python, Jupyter books, see the DOCUMENTATION section of this website.

## Course transformations

**All the course material below is under development as of October, 2020**

Some courses will have all (or most) material converted for deployment using Jupyter Books, others will include Python programming requirements, and some will have new interactive dashboards built for illustrating and exploring quantitative processes and concepts in courses taken by students in other disciplines.

* [EOSC 211](https://andrewloeppky.github.io/eosc211/title_211.html)
* [ATSC 301](https://phaustin.github.io/a301_code/)
* [ATSC 409](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/numeric/)
* [DSCI 100](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-100): This course is taught using the "R" language by Department of Statistics, UBC. 
    * [Here](dsci100-datasets.md) is a summary of data sets used in the winter 2020 version.
    * The OCESE project's role is to generate a Python version of the course, and to provide suitable datasets that are related to climate and other Earth, ocean or atmospheric science topics.  
* EOSC 340

Other courses likely to be impacted between 2020 and 2023 include EOSC 350, EOSC 354, EOSC 410/510, EOSC420, EOSC442, EOSC329, EOSC429, EOSC372, EOSC373, EOSC471.

## Dashboards for courses

These courses are starting to incorporate interactive dashboard apps enabling students to explore concepts, datasets or models & modelling. 

* [ENVR 300](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/envr300) Introduction to Research in Environmental Science.
    * Mauna Loa CO2 data: linear modelling of short segments of data. [the app](https://eoas05.eoas.ubc.ca/services/external/envr-300/monaloa/) and [the repo.](https://github.com/fhmjones/envr-300-monaloa)
    * Three signals: exploring the interactions between signals, "noise" and trends. The app (coming soon) and [the repo.](https://github.com/fhmjones/3signals)
    * Vancouver region Ozone: comparing a year of data at two locations. The app (coming soon) and [the repo.](https://github.com/fhmjones/envr-300-ozone)
* [EOSC 340](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc340) Global Climate Change. 
    * Details coming in winter 2021. 

## Examples from outside this project

* [Allen Downey's "How to think like a computer scientist"](https://phaustin.github.io/think_jupyter/preface.html)
* [David Pine's Scientific Python tutorial](http://phaustin.github.io/pyman/)

## Student examples

* Evan William's Landsat directed studies project
* Chris Rodell's work on translating EOSC 410 materials to Jupyter book format.
