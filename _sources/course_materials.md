# Courses

These sections outline the intentions and outcomes for each course affected by the OCESE project.

Some courses were significantly transformed in terms of pedagogy, resources, and/or content.

Other courses were impacted on smaller scales by introducing one or more interactive dashboard apps, helping instructors introduce new learning activities, coordinating computing hubs (e.g. for running Jupyter Notebooks), evaluating impacts of innovations, or by generating guidelines for installing Python, Jupyter, or other opensource computing facilities.

Where feasible the course impact summaries include comments on these aspects:

1. Goals: intended improvements, and why;
1. Actions taken
1. Students’ experiences;
1. Instructors’ experiences;
1. Costs: time taken & steps to design, build, test, deploy, & evaluate;
1. Lessons learned and next steps if any.

Courses and goals are summarized in the following two tables, one for each primary project objective.

### 1. Increasing students' exposure to quantitative aspects of Earth science

|Course|OCESE goals|
|:---|:---|
|****ENVR300**| 1) Make in-class exploration of the “modeling process” interactive.<BR>2) Provide a self-directed interactive resource to explore “signals, noise, trends & smoothing”.|
|**DSCI100**| Support development of a Python version of this “R” course, including use of an EOAS context.
|**EOSC112**| 1) Consult regarding climate science initiative by helping choose, implement & evaluate 2 activities.<BR>2) Support implementation & evaluation of an activity that uses the IPCC’s online Climate Atlas dashboard.<BR>3) Develop a dashboard based on a web resource about factors contributing to global temperature. |
|**EOSC116, 326**|1) Incorporate some aspect of climate science into the courses. <BR>2) Build a versatile, Python-based sketching activity dashboard.|
|**EOSC116**|Complete an opensource online learning resource and assignment. |
|**EOSC310**|Build a dashboard characterizing a daisyworld behavior as timeseries.|
|**EOSC323**|Incorporate a new interactive Mohr’s circle dashboard into students’ learning.|
|**EOSC325**|Design and implement 3 dashboards for a new 3rd yr hydrogeology course. |
|**EOSC340**|1) Compare trends in fractional low cloud cover for a range of  CMIP6 models and scenarios. <BR>2) Compare differences between CMIP6 models & scenarios for different climate variables.<BR>3) Implement  PrairieLearn; not an OCESE project but consistent with OCESE objectives. |
|****EOSC372**|Design & build a data-exploration dashboard for an assignment requiring students to observe & compare trace element & physical properties in water column at selected locations in 3 oceans.|
|**EOSC373**|Explore options for introducing data- or concept-exploration dashboards.|
|**EOSC429**|Design & build a dashboard for exploring 1D diffusion/advection of groundwater contamination.|
|**EOSC442**|Convert four MatLab exercises to Python Jupyter notebooks.|

<BR>

### 2. Enhancing computational & numerical literacy of EOAS graduates

|Course|OCESE goals|
|:---|:---|
|**ATSC301**|Serve as precedent for use of opensource resources and tactics in senior quantitative EOAS courses. Students develop Python skills, use opensource resources, and apply GitHub version control and collaboration practices. Automated grading is also used. |
|****EOSC211**|Full courses transformation of this introductory course on computing for Earth sciences.  <BR>1) convert all classroom activities, assignments and labs from MatLab to Python,<BR> 2) implement cloud based Jupyter hub technology for all computing, <BR> 3) automate (or semi-automate) grading of students’ work, <BR> 4) use an opensource textbook and deliver course content with similar open source technology,<BR> 5) build open source documentation for guidelines, tutorials and course content. |
|****EOSC354**|Convert 11 labs from MatLab to Python and establish efficient workflow for students who use their own computers but submit their code for manual grading. |
|**EOSC350**|1) Serve as precedent for use of Jupyter Notebooks as interactive learning resources for students with no programing skills.<BR>2) Help develop efficient procedures for using scalable Jupyter Hubs with custom environments. |
|**EOSC410/510**|Convert activities & assignments to Python. Completed by one graduate student while taking the course as part of their own learning strategy, but without OCESE official support. |
|**EOSC425**|Incorporate interactive dashboards to support learning about paleoclimate concepts. |
|**EOSC471**|Convert all labs (including custom MatLab code) to Python-based Jupyter Notebooks. Students will make minor adjustments to explore oceanography concepts but will write their own code. |

Three courses were identified in proposals but were not involved for various reasons: ENVR 420 and EOSC 329.
