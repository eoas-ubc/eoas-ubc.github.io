## Improvements

* Consolidate ocese reporting threads:
   * website,
   * Dep't showcase,
   * TLEF poster,
   * EER poster
* Do tutorials need to be more like precedent, i.e. modular such as [Helsinki "short course"](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/), or Atlasian tutorials, etc.? In fact, some may best be referenced to these types of existing ones tutorials?
* Merge *two github pages*. They could be rewritten as summaries, perhaps based on (or simply pointing to?) the [Atlasian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows). Maybe also refer to [Ch.12 of the DSCI100 text](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/version-control.html) (still wiht R as context, but updates in progress).
* Merge two environments pages.
* Review and update of [teaching with Jupyter NBs](tut-teachwith-jnbs.md).
* Jupyter startup: consider material from eosc442 and dsci100? How does this compare to docs used in EOSC 211? Should [Project Pythia's foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) be used instead?
* *Conda & environments* and *Using environments* need rationalizing and updating.
* Add jupytext to pages about setting up J-notebooks, using notebooks for teaching, how J-Books uses it, and likely others.
* Servers and hubs: move, rename & rewrite; it's not really a how-to since we & others are still iterating towards optimal choices. It needs to be more like "lessons learned".
* Other software tools - add quiz management for Canvas, PrairieLearn, support for JupyterBooks - others on the EOAS-UBC project board and elsewhere?
* "Rationalize" project evaluation pages.
* The faculty training page needs to incorporate "student training", including feedback and reflections from students. It has been renamed in the ToC, but needs reworking. The perspective is training as a project outcome.

## Additions

* Gather repositories with PA, FJ, JB, IS and collect at eoas-ubc.
* [Cited references](refs-citations.md) should be added throughout, as needed, based on QuEST project and FJ's Zotero collection. Or, a bibliography might be adequate unless an official publication is prpduced. This could be done using BibTex reference files - see the [Jupyter Books citation tutorial](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/tutorials/references.html).
* More about open-source, with examples, esepcially w.r.t. earth sciences. Eg: pangeo, SimpEG, Fatiango, geosci.xyz, (find ocgy and atsc examples), Jupyter books (again, referring to UBC's examples open.ubc.ca. [Numerical Techniques for AOE scientists](https://rhwhite.github.io/numeric_2022/), R. White and S. Allen, DSCI100 [python text](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/intro.html)  & [repo](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience-python).
* Review Andrew L.'s two tutorials in "not used". They may have good content but are perhaps a bit "long-winded".
* Revisit first-year accomplishments, including [md2canvas](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/md2canvas), AL's tutorials, and others. The [projects page](https://github.com/orgs/eoas-ubc/projects/1), and list of repositories may reveal items that need including or summarizing. Needs a walk-through with Phil.
* List courses that could leverage lessons we learned to align with students' needs, efficiency, and departmental/curricular norms.
* Gather quotes from workers (AL, BJ, IS) then place them in corresponding course pages, or in project evaluation pages. (Project eval pages may need consolidating.
* Convert “Project evaluation” into “lessons learned”? Or add a lessons learned page?

## Specific courses

* DSCI 100:
  * notes from Lindsey
  * capture the slack thread. Done to Jan 6, 2023, file "dsci100-slack-230106.xlsx".
  * new [text book](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/intro.html) & [repo](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience-python).
  * [Student's course repo](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-100-student-python).
* eosc442,
* atsc301,
* eosc211,
  * Add piazza data to eosc211
  * e211's startup docs, lock files and how-tos or tutorials.
* eosc429
* eosc471
* eosc373 (describe actions and outcomes with Hal's JNB)
* others?

## Done
* Courses top page: Change tables from "goals" to "delivered". Use "actions" listed in file `showcase notes 230215.docx`.
* Jupyter / Python install based on EOSC 211 (and maybe EOSC 354). Does this include use of condalock? - see [Jupyer NB Startup](jnb-startup-win.md).
* Project outcomes summary (Executive summary) needs reconfiguring more like the poster and showcase outline. Priorities are not efficient, and the whole thing is long winded.
* Merge "dashboard deployment" onto "Developing dashboards".
* merged Python startup and jupyternotebook startup. Python needs no "startup" but it can reference a few courses and resources.
