# Fixes needed
No particular order.

* e211 has midterm survey results in file ....FJwork\01-OCESE-tlef\courses\eosc211\midtermsurvey-211020.docx. Processing file seems lost, but raw data are in file "midterm2021w-raw.xlsx". Declared majors are in file "EOSC211_ClassList.xlsx".
* 211 piazza data: maybe compare middle of term with end of term chaos? Or find other comment? (Note there is a Piazza Analysis tool/paper (see file "AIED2019_Piazza_workshop1.pdf").
* Move "General feedback about using dashboards in lessons:" section in "crs-eosc325.html" to a new page called "teaching and learning with dashboards" (or something like that).
* Add txt2qti guidelines in "Other software tools", from ...\01-OCESE-tlef\courses\eosc325\questions\text2qti-guidelines.docx
* Add pandoc to "other tools" list.
