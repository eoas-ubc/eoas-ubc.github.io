# Fixes needed to documentation
No particular order.

* Project data: using the [Accomplishments G-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102730173326762252425), add relevant data or items to each J-Book course page.
* specific courses: update pages for
   * eosc442,
   * atsc301,
   * 211,
   * envr 420,
   * eosc329,
   * others?
* github and workflows to be rewritten as summaries, perhaps based on (or simply pointing to?) the [Atlasian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
* Jupyter NB startup needs updating to use material from eosc442 and dsci100 material. How does this compare to docs used in EOSC 211?
* Jupyter / Python install based on EOSC 211 (and maybe EOSC 354). Does this include use of condalock?
* Faculty Pro-D page needs more content.
* Progress at Nov 2022 needs writing.
* Tools page: clarify what's needed, maybe make sub-pages.
