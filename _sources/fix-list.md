# Fixes to documentation

No particular order.

See also **[issues](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas-ubc.github.io/issues)** at the host repository, **[requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DL2YDthzEbZijx35nVyveSstU5frQdzA/edit#gid=173746334)** (Google sheet) for each project component, and **[accomplishments & data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit#gid=979565415)** (Google sheet) for project outcomes.

* Project data: using the [Accomplishments G-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUk1_FHItUgzuyg2aJ-dX6XpMABmFSPe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102730173326762252425), add relevant data or items to each J-Book course page.
* More about open-source, with examples - pangeo, SimpEG, Fatiango, geosci.xyz, (find ocgy and atsc examples), Jupyter books (again, referring to UBC's examples) etc. justifying especially for earth sciences. Also recommendations for raising awareness with open.ubc.ca.
* incorporate pointers to [Project Pythia's foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) and [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) into guidelines & resources.
* Add piazza data to eosc211
* incorporate e211's startup docs and lock files into e211 page and how-tos or tutorials.
* specific courses: update pages for
  * eosc442,
  * atsc301,
  * eosc211,
  * others?
* github and workflows to be rewritten as summaries, perhaps based on (or simply pointing to?) the [Atlasian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
* Jupyter NB startup needs updating to use material from eosc442 and dsci100 material. How does this compare to docs used in EOSC 211? Should [Project Pythia's foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) be used instead?
* Jupyter / Python install based on EOSC 211 (and maybe EOSC 354). Does this include use of condalock?
* Faculty Pro-D page needs more content.
* Progress at Nov 2022 needs writing.
* Tools page: clarify what's needed, maybe make sub-pages.
* JNB deployment options - pros and cons. The [Servers and hubs](cloud-servers.md) page?
