## Improvements

* Jupyter / Python install based on EOSC 211 (and maybe EOSC 354). Does this include use of condalock?
* Merge two github pages. They could be rewritten as summaries, perhaps based on (or simply pointing to?) the [Atlasian tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows). Maybe also refer to [Ch.12 of the DSCI100 text](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/version-control.html) (still wiht R as context, but updates in progress).
* Jupyter NB pages
  * The [Jupyterhub Tutorial](tut-jhubs.md) is mis-named. Consolidate this with [Jupyter NB startup](jnotebooks-startup.md) and possibly some of [teaching with Jupyter NBs](tut-teachwith-jnbs.md).
  * Consolidate parts of *Jupyterhub Tutorial* into *Servers and hubs*.
  * Jupyter startup page needs updating to use material from eosc442 and dsci100 material. How does this compare to docs used in EOSC 211? Should [Project Pythia's foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) be used instead?
  * Jupyter Hubs: what options? Needs PA's input. Refer to 2i2c's documentation.
  * Jupyter notebook vs emerging Jupyter lab? This might need no more than a mention of this evolution as an example of the "moving target" for instructors. Notebook has been "sunset" - being replaced with a one-page version of lab.
  * *GitHub & Git workflows* and *Git introduction* pages need rationalizing.
  * *Conda & environments* and *Using environments* need rationalizing and updating.
* Merge two environment pages
* Tools page: clarify what's needed, maybe make sub-pages.
* Add jupytext to pages about setting up J-notebooks, using notebooks for teaching, how J-Books uses it, and likely others.
* Refine the inclusion of Jupyter Notebooks. Python Skills check is included but I'm not sure if it's done the best way possible. And there may be other notebooks for tutorials or guidelines. But get one right first.

## Additions

* where to house repositories? Those with PA, FJ, students, EOAS-
* [Cited references](refs-citations.md) should be added throughout, as needed. This could be done using BibTex reference files - see the [Jupyter Books citation tutorial](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/tutorials/references.html).
* More about open-source, with examples, esepcially w.r.t. earth sciences. Eg: pangeo, SimpEG, Fatiango, geosci.xyz, (find ocgy and atsc examples), Jupyter books (again, referring to UBC's examples open.ubc.ca. [Numerical Techniques for AOE scientists](https://rhwhite.github.io/numeric_2022/), R. White and S. Allen, DSCI100 [python text](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/intro.html)  & [repo](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience-python)

## Specific courses

* DSCI 100:
  * notes from Lindsey
  * capture the slack thread. Done to Jan 6, 2023, file "dsci100-slack-230106.xlsx".
  * new [text book](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/intro.html) & [repo](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience-python).
* eosc442,
* atsc301,
* eosc211,
  * Add piazza data to eosc211
  * e211's startup docs, lock files and how-tos or tutorials.
* eosc429
* eosc471
* eosc373 (describe actions and outcomes with Hal's JNB)
* others?
