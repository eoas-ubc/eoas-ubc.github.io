# DSCI 100

## Official description

**Data Science 100: Introduction to Data Science**

Use of data science tools to summarize, visualize, and analyze data. Sensible workflows and clear interpretations are emphasized.

Prerequisites: At least first year standing in Science at UBC. No previous programming skills necessary.

Course [github repository](https://github.com/ubc-dsci/dsci-100-student).

## Role in EOAS curriculum

Not required but likely to become an acceptible first exposure to programming and statistics.

## OCESE project objectives

Basically to generate a Python-based version of the course with an Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric sciences context for all exercises.

* Convert all "R" teaching materials to Python
* Convert all "R" classroom and homework exercises to Python
* Adapt the existing course website to suit the Python and EOAS contexts.
* Adapt existing "R"-based [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) grading tactics to work with the Python exercises.
* Adapt existing text book for the Python context.
* Ensure there are stable, sustainable Jupyter Hub facilities at UBC for with reliable tech-support for instructors and teaching assistants.

## Open resources

* Student-facing [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ubc-dsci/dsci-100-student) for the existing "R" version of the course.
* Summary of [selected details](crs-dsci100-details.md) about the Course's Learning Outcomes (CLO's), topics and tools.
