# EOSC 116

## Official course description

**Mesozoic Earth: Time of the Dinosaurs**: Earth's tectonics, climate, and oceans during the time of the dinosaurs. Reading the fossil record of Earth from its earliest origins up to and including the Mesozoic, 250 - 65 million years ago.

## OCESE project objectives

1. Implement an exercise that uses the [Global Temperature](dashboards.md) dashboard app to explore anthropogenic aspects of climate change to facilitate comparison between present and past climate patterns.

2. Build a versatile dashboard to emulate sketch-based learning activities that will allow instructors to specify a background image upon which students can sketch or add annotations. Initial activities are to be based on precedent from activities developed with older software that has become awkward to deploy. Examples are (or were) live at [eg 1](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~quest/Lab3-sketch.html), [eg 2](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~quest/Lab1-2sketches.html) and [eg 3](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~quest/Sketch-NorthAm.html). PDF versions of the lab exercises can be seen at <a href="files/Lab3-sketch.pdf">PDF eg1</a> and <a href="files/Lab1-2sketches.pdf">PDF eg2</a>.

## Actions taken

1. The [Global Temperature](dashboards.md) dashboard app was use.

2. A dashboard app that will enable students to answer questions by sketching or annotating a given figure is under development - see the "interactive images" app on the [Dashboards page](dashboards.md). This app replaces an older facility with an app built using the same code library as other OCESE dashboard apps, and increases the versatility by allowing students to specify the figure they will annotate.

## Lessons learned

Instructors had little time to be creative during COVID and only used the [Global Temperature](dashboards.md) dashboard because it was completed for other courses. That's OK - people can only apply energy when time and inclination permit.
