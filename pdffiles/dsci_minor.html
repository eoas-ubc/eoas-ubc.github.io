<strong>Project
Summary</strong>:&nbsp;University
graduates in many
disciplines need
skills to organize,
interact with and
extract meaning from
data via reproducible
and auditable methods.
Through this project,
we will create and
sustain widely
accessible learning
opportunities in data
science and contribute
to a data-literate
citizenry.
Specifically, we will:
(1) review and broaden
DSCI 100: Introduction
to Data Science, based
on campus-wide
consultation; (2)
create a data science
minor available to any
undergraduate, which
involves developing
seven new courses; (3)
create professional
development
opportunities for
faculty and TAs to
share student-focused
pedagogies for
teaching data science;
and (4) develop and
implement evaluation
plans to assess the
effectiveness of
(1)–(3). This project
would provide
thousands of
undergraduates from
any discipline with
foundational data
skills and the
opportunity to
complement their
degree with a relevant
minor.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
This project is
synergistic with other
TLEF proposals which
address
discipline-specific
efforts in data
science curriculum (<a href="https://bit.ly/2MlAC68" style="color:rgb(43,166,203)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://bit.ly/2MlAC68&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592005016531000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1Xh4iwuR_uAZlKjvYUTi3sDURCA">https://bit.ly/2MlAC68</a>).<br>

<strong>Project
Objectives</strong>:
Rationale<br>
<br>
Data science can be
defined as extracting
value from data
through reproducible
and auditable
processes. A strategic
priority for the
Faculty of Science is
to provide
high-quality,
coordinated, widely
accessible learning
opportunities in data
science to a broad
range of UBC-V
undergraduates. As few
opportunities to
acquire these skills
currently exist, we
will build on UBC-V’s
expertise with the
successful Master of
Data Science (MDS)
program, and the
recently launched DSCI
100 course, to provide
this curriculum.<br>
<br>
Overall Objectives<br>
<br>
1. Review &amp;
broaden (as needed)
DSCI 100 to serve
undergraduates in a
wide range of
disciplines, whether
or not they will
continue with
additional data
science learning.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
2. Develop a minor in
data science that
could be paired with
any major,
incorporating DSCI 100
and seven new courses
with short
pre-requisite chains.<br>
3. Create professional
development for
faculty and TAs to
provide training in
the foundational data
science toolkit and
share student-focused
pedagogies for
teaching data science.<br>
4. Develop and
implement evaluation
plans to assess the
effectiveness of the
foundational data
science course (DSCI
100), the minor and
the professional
development
activities.<br>
<br>
Expected Impacts<br>
<br>
DSCI 100 was launched
in 2018WT2 with 59
students as a
foundational data
science course with
student-active design.
In 2019W, 250 students
are registered and the
two offered sections
are full. The course
could grow to serve
~2000 students, based
both on experience
from Berkeley and
anticipation that some
large
specializations/majors
in Science may require
DSCI 100. We expect
the course to be able
to meet the
foundational data
science needs of
multiple disciplines.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
Although several other
undergraduate courses
at UBC-V currently
offer opportunities to
learn some data
science content, they
also typically cover
theoretical approaches
and thus involve long
pre-requisite chains
(e.g., CPSC 304 &amp;
340, STAT 406).
Building courses
tailored to students
whose goal is to
practice data science
can lead to the
creation of courses
that are more
accessible and
targeted to data
science content and
pedagogies.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
The seven new courses
we propose to build in
this project will be
created with this
student goal in-mind.
They, along with DSCI
100, will form the
core of a new data
science minor (which
may potentially
inspire a data science
major). Additionally,
students will also be
able to count one
data-intensive
disciplinary course in
the minor. These
courses will provide
broad access to data
science education with
fewer barriers,
serving both students
pursuing the proposed
data science minor as
well as those who only
complete a portion of
the courses in the
minor.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
All courses will
incorporate
state-of-the-art tools
used in research and
industry (R &amp;
Python, Jupyter,
GitHub, etc.),
authentic projects
with real data sets,
and research-informed
pedagogies. To enable
this, the project will
provide professional
development (PD) for
faculty and TAs in
hands-on workshops to
train them in the
foundational data
science toolkit (e.g.,
similar to UBC’s
Jupyter Day) and share
evidence-based,
student-focused
pedagogies for
teaching data science
(e.g., similar to
UBC’s Master of Data
Science Instructor
training workshop).<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
These efforts will
increase UBC’s
pedagogical capacity
to help students
develop data skills.
This work aligns with
UBC’s Strategic plan
(Strategies 11 &amp;
13), TLEF criteria for
students and faculty
reached and consulted,
and complements
existing and emerging
efforts to infuse data
skills throughout
specializations (e.g.
see TLEF proposals
from Ivanochko and
Hallam).<span>&nbsp;</span><br>

<strong>Work
Plan, Timeline &amp;
Milestones</strong>:
Since 2018, over 35
UBC faculty members
(from Science, Applied
Science, and Arts),
two staff members, and
a Science
Undergraduate Society
(SUS) representative
have contributed to
discussions
envisioning data
science educational
opportunities for
UBC-V undergraduates.
This group gathered
input from surveys
(described below) and
developed a set of
recommendations for
creating accessible
data science learning
opportunities. The
recommendations align
with UBC’s strategic
goals for
transformative
learning through
program renewal,
interdisciplinary
learning,
evidence-based
pedagogies, and
practice with real
world problems.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
The project proposed
here addresses
specific
recommendations to
broaden a foundational
course; create a
minor; use
evidence-informed,
active pedagogy; use
open-source tools and
align tool-use across
disciplines; create
and sustain
professional
development
opportunities for
faculty, TAs, and
staff to learn/share
best practices in data
science pedagogy; and
evaluate the impact on
student learning.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
A faculty
sub-committee from
Statistics and
Computer Science (all
co-PIs on this
project) created a
proposal for an
undergraduate data
science minor
accessible to any UBC
undergraduate. Like
all DSCI courses and
the MDS program, the
minor will be the
joint responsibility
of these two
departments. With this
preparation, TLEF
funding is timely to
bring these plans to
fruition.<br>
<br>
Summary of completed
work:<br>
<br>
1. Compiled a list of
institutions offering
similar programs in
North America.<br>
<br>
2. Conducted workshops
&amp; discussions
involving faculty,
staff, and a student
from Science, Applied
Science and Arts.<br>
<br>
3. Piloted DSCI 100, a
foundational course
for a data science
minor, starting in
2018W2. This course
incorporated
evidence-based
teaching practices and
technologies. The
piloting and
preliminary evaluation
offered invaluable
information on how to
structure and organize
future courses in this
area.<br>
<br>
4. Surveyed faculty
(64 participants from
5 Faculties, in March
2019), graduating BSc
students (in May
2019), graduate
students (in June
2019) across campus,
and students in DSCI
100. The responses
reveal which DSCI 100
learning goals are
considered most key,
and indicate that
students in
upper-level courses
could achieve more in
discipline-specific
data-rich settings if
they had prior
foundational data
science experience.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
5. Held an open event
(August 2019) for
faculty interested in
learning more about
DSCI 100. Attended by
faculty members from
at least 4 Faculties.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
6. Developed a
proposal for a data
science minor (<a href="http://bit.ly/dsci-minor" style="color:rgb(43,166,203)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://bit.ly/dsci-minor&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592005016531000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7eec6Z-MKrctVgLvjpA3qgWLaDg">http://bit.ly/dsci-minor</a>),
including the
following draft
learning goals:<br>
<br>
<br>
By completing this
minor, students will
be able to:<br>
<br>
- Identify and collect
data necessary to
answer a given
research question
through sampling
and/or through
extracting data from
pre-existing sources
(databases, html web
pages, web APIs, etc)<br>
- Manipulate messy,
ill-formed data to
extract meaningful
insights.<br>
- Map and apply an
appropriate data
analysis approach to a
given research
question.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
- Tailor data science
methods to deal with
diverse data types
across diverse
subject-area domains.<br>
- Apply fundamental
statistical thinking
in the data analysis
process.<br>
- Apply fundamental
programming principles
in the data analysis
process.<br>
- Communicate results
of data science
experiments to diverse
audiences through data
visualizations,
written work and oral
presentations.<br>
- Employ best
practices for
collaboration for
projects that involve
both code and people.<br>
<br>
This preliminary work
serves as a solid
foundation for the
proposed work, the
bulk of which involves
developing courses for
a data science minor.
The planned new
courses are designed
to allow students to
meet the learning
goals listed above.
The first two years
mainly concentrate on
new course development
and piloting, leading
to the availability of
the minor mid-Year 2.
The third year focuses
on completing the last
course development and
full implementation of
most new courses.
Evaluation will be an
integral part of the
work and will inform
decisions throughout
the project’s life
span.<br>
<br>
The novelty of this
data science minor
presents itself as an
excellent opportunity
to exchange ideas with
colleagues within and
beyond UBC and to
contribute to the
growing body of
knowledge in data
science education.
Therefore, when
possible, we will
disseminate our work
to gather input and
share our experiences
and findings broadly.<br>
<br>
Drawing on the best
practices in data
science, this project
will proceed as
outlined below. In our
three-year plan, we
have staggered
sequences of course
development such that
each course has one
4-month term for
curriculum proposal
development, followed
by two terms of course
materials development
before its first
offering. The maximum
number of courses
starting the sequence
in any term is 2.
Details of the courses
listed in this work
plan are below in the
Project Outputs
section (course
abbreviations are used
here).<br>

<strong>Project
Outputs</strong>:
The primary
deliverables from this
project are a course
revision (DSCI 100), 7
new courses,
pedagogies and open
educational resources
(OER) for teaching
data science, and
professional
development for
teaching data science.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
Below we outline
existing and proposed
courses for this minor
(<a href="http://bit.ly/dsci-minor" style="color:rgb(43,166,203)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://bit.ly/dsci-minor&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592005016532000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEneZ8yUCP4uUfsgGE2-SoZNDbw4A">http://bit.ly/dsci-minor</a>),
that would be affected
by this project. DSCI
100 forms the
foundation for the
minor, followed by
three other required
courses, plus
electives. Students

Pedagogies<br>
<br>
In these newly
developed courses we
will incorporate
evidence-based,
inclusive, active
learning pedagogies to
engage with real-world
data using
technological tools
for visualization and
analysis. This will
allow students to use
methods to think
critically about the
world, draw
conclusions from data
considering ethical
implications, and
visualize and
communicate results
effectively.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Open Educational
Resources<br>
<br>
Custom learning
materials will be
developed for each of
the 7 new courses and
deployed online under
an open license
following the standard
model for OER
development in data
science: literate code
documents (e.g.,
Jupyter Notebooks or R
Markdown) rendered
with a static website
generator (such as Git
book) and deployed on
GitHub. For example,
see the existing DSCI
100 textbook<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/" style="color:rgb(43,166,203)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592005016532000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGn7ZoUb6dM50GRLLgmJfuPfWCFPg">https://ubc-dsci.<wbr>github.io/introduction-to-<wbr>datascience/</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Professional
Development<br>
<br>
Workshops for
instructors on
teaching data science
will be developed and
run annually. Learning
materials for the
workshops will be
deployed on GitHub for
easy re-use by future
workshop facilitators.
Several of the co-PI’s
on this proposal have
experience creating
and delivering such
workshops. For
example, in August
2019 Patrick Walls, a
co-PI on this TLEF
proposal, ran
JupyterDay. This event
attracted over 60
students, fellows and
faculty for instructor
workshops and
presentations on
teaching data science
(see<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/patrickwalls/jupyterday2019" style="color:rgb(43,166,203)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://github.com/patrickwalls/jupyterday2019&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592005016532000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEypIeX6uSNqaUdyQI16Q7b0b1tdg">https://github.com/<wbr>patrickwalls/jupyterday2019</a>).
Additionally, the lead
PI and a co-PI on this
proposal, Tiffany
Timbers and Michael
Gelbart, ran a Master
of Data Science
Instructor training
two-day workshop in
August 2019, which
focused on best
pedagogical practices
for teaching Data
Science. This event
was attended by 12
faculty members (<a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/MDS_instructor_training/" style="color:rgb(43,166,203)" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://ubc-mds.github.io/MDS_instructor_training/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592005016532000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_5H4sW-GU2zjfIEwxCebfuxc5uQ">https://ubc-mds.github.io/<wbr>MDS_instructor_training/</a>).<span>&nbsp;</span><br>

<strong>Project
Impact</strong>:
Data science skills
are in great demand in
research and industry
across virtually all
disciplines. This is
because nearly all
disciplines now
involve bigger, or
more complex data and
as such, students need
additional data skills
to succeed and be
competitive within
these disciplines.
Thus to have UBC-V
graduates stand out in
both academic research
and industry,
regardless of
discipline, they
require quality
opportunities to
acquire data science
skills.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tangible benefits to
undergraduates (aligns
with Objectives 1, 2,
and 4):<br>
<br>
1. Data science
knowledge and skills
to handle complex data
and use it to tackle a
wide-variety of
questions relevant to
many fields in a
reproducible and
auditable manner.<br>
2. Exposure to, and
practice with, open
access educational
resources created
using authentic, open
source data science
tools (e.g., Git book
textbooks, Jupyter
notebook electronic
worksheets).<br>
3. Evidence-based,
inclusive, active
learning pedagogies
suitable for data
science (e.g., live
and paired
programming, flipped
classrooms, peer code
review, auto- and peer
grading, group
projects).<br>
4. Data science minor
undergraduates will be
well qualified for
future work with a
data science or data
analysis component.
This could take place
in a variety of fields
and sectors spanning
industry, research,
government, etc. For
those who do not
continue directly in
the field, they will
bring a data science
perspective to their
career path of choice.<br>
5. Evaluation
framework and
accompanying tools
that can be used to
assess the impact of
new or existing
strategies on student
experience in relevant
courses.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Tangible benefits
extending beyond
undergraduates (aligns
with Objectives 3 and
4):<br>
<br>
1. Data science skills
injected into UBC
research labs through
the training of
graduate students as
TAs for undergraduate
data science courses;
faculty upskilling
through co-teaching
opportunities.<br>
2. A community of
practice around data
science at UBC-V for
faculty to engage in
peer-to-peer sharing
of best practices
(e.g., 32 of the
faculty survey
respondents from 5
Faculties indicated
interest in being part
of discussions for
this project).<br>
3. A higher profile
for the Faculty of
Science and UBC-V in
data science education
and potential to
become a model for a
data science
curriculum for other
institutions.<br>
4. Findings that can
be shared with UBC and
broader community
through dissemination
efforts to inform best
practices and receive
feedback.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
To maintain these
benefits, the
developed resources
will be integrated
with existing learning
technology systems as
well as being
available as OERs,
while the created
professional
development will
enable these courses
and practices to
continue beyond the
development team.<br>
<br>
<strong>Evaluation
Plan</strong>:&nbsp;The
success of the overall
project will be
assessed by meeting
the anticipated
project outcomes in a
timely manner and
evaluation will be an
integral part of the
project to inform
progress. In
preparation for this
proposal, we have
developed a logic
model to describe the
overall project and
the evaluation plan
emerged from that
exercise. We also
reached out to
undergraduate and
graduate students and
faculty in Science, as
well as other
Faculties, to gather
input and feedback.
Institutions across
North America offering
comparable programs
were reviewed to
create benchmarks for
evaluation.
Furthermore, the
Skylight team that
will support the
evaluation activities
of this TLEF project
has worked with the
Master of Data Science
(MDS) program for
their program
evaluation since its
inception. Their
experience from
evaluating the MDS
will help inform
evaluation this data
science TLEF project.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
The overarching goal
for project evaluation
is to capture student
learning and
experience in DSCI 100
and the newly
developed courses in
the minor to inform
course effectiveness
during the pilot
offerings, and to
inform further
revisions. We also
plan to capture
instructor and
teaching assistant
experience to ensure
they are
well-supported in
teaching these newly
developed courses.<br>
<br>
Student learning will
be assessed by course
specific assessment
tools (e.g.,
assignments, exams)
that will be created
as part of the course
development work.
Student experience in
terms of their
expectations,
interactions with
course materials and
specific activities,
and their satisfaction
with the course(s)
will be captured
through carefully
designed evaluation
tools such as surveys
or focus group
questions. We will use
validated evaluation
tools when/if
available, otherwise
we will develop
homegrown tools. We
anticipate tailoring
the evaluation tools
for each course in the
minor to evaluate
their unique
contributions to
student experience.
The results of this
project will be shared
back with instructors
and TAs to further
refine the newly
developed courses.<br>
<br>
We will also evaluate
the effectiveness of
the faculty and TA
professional
development workshops
to promote
implementation of best
practices (e.g.,
hands-on analysis of
real-world data and
using state of the art
techniques/tools) and
to uncover further
needs around
professional
development and
support.<br>
<br>
The process that we go
through developing and
implementing this
minor in an
interdisciplinary
setting presents
itself as an
opportunity to learn
from. To this end, we
will attempt to
capture the process of
putting together a
program of this scale
to document lessons
learned and to share
with the broader
community.<br>
<br>
<strong>Student
Involvement</strong>:
Students are key
stakeholders in this
project and the team
welcomes their input.
Students (both May
2019 Science graduates
and DSCI 100 students)
were part of the
initial evaluation
efforts and will
continue to be
involved throughout
the project providing
their input and
feedback by
participating in
surveys and focus
groups. In DSCI 100
our surveys have (and
will continue to)
collect information on
students’ learning,
experience (with
course technology and
structure) and
confidence in applying
the data science
skills they have
acquired. For Science
graduates our survey
focused on whether
recent graduates
acquired data skills,
and if they did, how
they acquired them, as
well as their
confidence in those
skills.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
During the preliminary
work, we received
invaluable input from
the Science
Undergraduate Society
(SUS) representative
who attended several
meetings during the
past year and received
all the email
communications. We
will continue to have
an undergraduate
student representative
(SUS member) in future
discussions. The SUS
representative will be
our link to other
students and will
receive all
correspondence, will
be invited to key
meetings and asked to
provide input.<br>
<br>
As part of the overall
project evaluation,
graduate students will
be hired to help the
project’s TLF (see
below) collect and
analyze data to
support the evaluation
activities, presenting
itself as a unique
learning opportunity
for students to gain
skills in evaluation
and to be part of a
professional
community.<br>
<br>
Professional
development workshops
will be a great
opportunity for these
and other graduate
students to take part
and develop skills in
teaching data science
and being part of the
broader teaching
community. These
experiences will
benefit graduate
students in their
post-UBC careers.<span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<strong>Facilities
Requirements</strong>:
Ideal data science
learning spaces
facilitate the use of
technology (by the
Instructors and
students) as well as
collaboration. We
identify critical
design features of a
data science learning
space:<br>
<br>
* Robust WiFi<br>
* Table surfaces<br>
* AC power at all
seats<br>
* Multi-input,
multi-output
audio-visual system<br>
<br>
Examples of innovative
learning spaces (which
include wireless
screen sharing): LSK
121 (capacity of 64),
ORCH 4074 (capacity of
72), HENN 200
(capacity of 180),
LIFE 2201 (capacity of
294).<br>
<br>
Standard examples:
ORCH 3018 (capacity of
48), DMP 110 (capacity
of 120), ESB 1012
(capacity of 150), DMP
310 (capacity of 160).<br>
<br>
We also anticipate
additional needs in
learning technology
(LT) capacity
associated with these
courses as enrolment
expands in the second
and third years of the
project. Use of
existing LT (e.g.,
Canvas with existing
methods for linking
course components) is
expected for 2020,
while part of Year 1
activity will be to
investigate further
needs and integrations
to be undertaken in
Year 2 of the project.<br>
